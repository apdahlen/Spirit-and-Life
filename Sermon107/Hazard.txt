STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Aabenbarelse” — carries theological weight: revelation not merely manifestation, but divine self-disclosure.
* “Herlighed” — not mere glory in aesthetic sense; denotes divine majesty and radiant holiness.
* “Naade” — grace in a Lutheran doctrinal sense: unmerited favor grounded in Christ.
* “Forsmagen” — foretaste, with eschatological implication.
* “Klenodie” — treasure/precious jewel; metaphorical, spiritually weighty.
* “Kjødelig Begeistring” — fleshly enthusiasm; suggests carnal religious excitement as opposed to spiritual sobriety.
* “Ydmygelse” / “Sønderknuselse” — humiliation / brokenness before God; penitential language.
* “Vækkelse” — awakening; pietistic category of spiritual awakening.
* “Fordømmelse” — condemnation in Pauline forensic sense.
* “Levnet” — life conduct, manner of life.
* “Aands Fattigdom” — poverty of spirit (Matt. 5:3 resonance).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with semicolon pivots that build doctrinal pressure.
* Sermonic rhetorical questions that must not be softened.
* Parallel constructions (“Er han opstaaen… er han opfaren… sidder han…”) requiring preservation.
* Embedded biblical quotations integrated into argument.
* Intensified repetition (“Min Synd! min Synd! min Synd!”).

Theological Hazards:

* Fear before divine revelation as consequence of sin.
* Distinction between unconverted fear and child-of-God fear.
* Union with Christ in death and resurrection.
* Justification: “ingen Fordømmelse.”
* Sanctification: daily fear and mortification of the flesh.
* Assurance balanced with warning against falling.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest Lutheran-pietistic admonition.
* Personal pastoral narrative of humiliation.
* Direct address (“Dyrebare Sjæl, tror du dette?”).
* Urgency without sentimentalism.
* Severe joy held together with trembling.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Min Synd! min Synd! min Synd!” — penitential cry; echoes Psalmic lament and Pauline anguish (Rom. 7). Must retain repetition.
* “Hvo som staar, se til, at han ikke falder” — 1 Cor. 10:12; preserve warning force.
* “Jeg gaar i Fare, hvor jeg gaar” — hymn-like expression of continual spiritual peril.
* “Overflødig Synd, end overflødigere Naade” — Romans 5:20 paraphrase; grace superabounding.
* “Menneskefisker” — Matt. 4:19; retain biblical metaphor.
* “Kjærligheden driver Frygten ud” — 1 John 4:18; doctrinal link between grace and fear.
* “Begravne med ham ved Daaben til Døden” — Rom. 6:4; union with Christ in baptism.

Literal translation risks obscuring spiritual force where idiom carries doctrinal resonance; biblical phrasing should be retained in structure though with modern pronouns.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Cosmic signs at death and resurrection demonstrate divine lordship.
2. Divine revelation produces fear in sinful humanity.
3. Scriptural examples of fear before divine manifestation.
4. Sin as root of fear; even believers experience deep trembling.
5. Personal narrative illustrating humiliation before resurrection glory.
6. From humiliation to fruitfulness: God’s grace through weakness.
7. Theological resolution: love casts out fear; grace superabounds.
8. Union with risen Christ grounds joy.
9. Exhortation: live Easter truth in daily repentance and joy.
10. Climactic proclamation: “Christ is risen.”

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 23:44–45 (darkness; veil torn).
* Matthew 28:2–8 (earthquake; angel; fear and joy).
* Matthew 28:18 (all authority).
* Luke 1:12, 30 (Zacharias; Mary).
* Matthew 14:26–27 (walking on water).
* Luke 24:36–43 (appearing after resurrection; eating before them).
* Romans 7:24.
* 1 Corinthians 10:12.
* 1 John 4:18.
* Romans 5:20.
* Romans 8:1.
* Romans 6:4–10.
* Luke 5:8.
* Matthew 4:19.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain severity of fear before holiness.
* Preserve humiliating self-exposure in pastoral anecdote.
* Maintain direct address and pressing question.
* Do not soften warnings about falling or losing the treasure.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skal” rendered as “shall,” not weakened to “will” where obligation or certainty is intended.
* “maa” rendered as “must.”
* Conditional inevitabilities retained in full force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Naade — grace.
* Synd — sin.
* Frygt — fear.
* Herlighed — glory.
* Retfærdighed — righteousness.
* Fordømmelse — condemnation.
* Opstaaen — risen.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Treasure (Klenodie) preserved.
* Fisher of men retained.
* Burial and rising imagery preserved.
* Flesh vs. Spirit contrast maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Fear vs. joy maintained.
* Humiliation vs. blessing.
* Warning vs. consolation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sermonic sentences.
* Maintain rhetorical repetition.
* Retain climactic proclamation structure.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Fear and Joy.

First Day of Easter.

And when the Sabbath was past, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to behold the tomb. And behold, there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled the stone from the door and sat upon it. And his appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow. And the guards trembled for fear of him and became as dead men. But the angel answered and said to the women: Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus, the crucified. He is not here; for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. And behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him. See, I have told you. And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.


On the three hours immediately before Jesus gave up his Spirit upon the Cross, Luke tells that the sun was darkened and that the veil of the temple was rent in two. At his resurrection Matthew reports in our text that there was a great earthquake, and that the angel of the Lord descended from heaven as lightning and rolled the stone from the tomb. The Lord’s death and resurrection were an event which set the powers of heaven and earth in motion to show that he who is Lord over death is he who has all authority both in heaven and on earth.

But every revelation of this divine power, whether in the small or in the great, over the single individual or over the whole of humanity, works terror and fear in every sinful human heart, which thereby comes to know both its impotence and its judgment.

When the angel was revealed in the temple to Zacharias, he was afraid; and when he came to the Virgin Mary, who should become the Mother of God, it was the same with her, wherefore he also said to her: “Fear not, Mary, for you have found grace with God.” When Jesus was revealed to the disciples walking upon the sea, they were terrified; and when after the resurrection he suddenly stood in the midst of them, they were seized with fear, so that he had to calm them by showing them his hands and his feet, and when their fear thereafter passed over into so exceeding a joy that it would almost take from them their faith, he calmed them again by eating before their eyes.

What wonder if fear and terror seized not only the guard, but also the women who on Easter morning came to seek the crucified, when the forces of nature were shaken and the power of the Lord’s glory was revealed and the angel spoke to them: “He is not here; he is risen.”

It is sin which works fear when I am at once placed face to face with the holy and almighty God, whether this be accompanied by extraordinary manifestations or whether it occurs through the Spirit’s awakening and testimony in the heart.

My sin! my sin! my sin! — that too becomes a child of God’s continual lament here below, as it weighed upon the Apostle Paul and made him cry out: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?” And although also a carnal and unconverted man will be filled with fear and terror when God’s nearness is revealed over him in some visible and supernatural manner and will tremble before the judgment which he knows in his heart, yet it is a child of God who most deeply perceives fear in the face of the revelation of God’s power, not only because a child of God most deeply knows his sin and God’s holy righteousness, but because he has also known the foretaste of the blessedness of eternal life and fears, so long as he walks in sinful flesh, to lose this incomprehensible treasure. For “let him who stands take heed lest he fall;” “I go in peril where I go, and never know myself secure.” What wonder therefore if these women, to whom the angel had proclaimed the blessed tidings of Easter morning: “Christ is risen!” went away from the tomb with fear. Can fear be separated even from the most blessed joy here in the world, unless a man forgets to search his heart at every time and to remember his sin?

I recall an Easter morning when I was to preach. I had been taken up with the thought of the victorious power of the resurrection and had prepared a sermon which in my opinion should resound with that triumph which as a shout of joy ought to pass through the whole congregation on the morning of the resurrection and sound up to heaven to be met by the angels’ answer. I fear that there had entered fleshly enthusiasm into my proclamation and that I had forgotten fear before the revelation of the Lord’s glory. I ascended the pulpit, as it seemed to me, festively disposed and well prepared. It was to become a true “Easter sermon.” I prayed God for his blessing. But when I had come into the midst of reading the old, simple text in Mark and again met the words: “Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb? And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away,” then I was seized by a strange feeling; my breast began to heave, my throat was constricted, and my eyes were filled with tears despite all my efforts. The letters ran together before me, and my tongue could not bring forth a word. So I stood for a while mute and in a state of unspeakable humiliation and brokenness. The Lord’s holiness and power had revealed themselves to me, and I had been made to remember my sins. When at last I as it were tore myself free and read the remainder of the text, my whole sermon was gone, and I would gladly have crept under the earth for shame. O how I wished that I had never been a priest! But preach I must, and I know not to this day what I spoke in my fearful and poor condition. Only this I know, that some days thereafter, while I still felt cast down and humbled over the events of Easter Day, a man came to me, opened his heart amid many tears, and asked me to show him the way to salvation. He had been awakened by that Easter sermon over which I was ashamed. When he was gone, I felt myself tenfold more confounded and would like Peter have cast myself at the Savior’s feet and said: “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man!” But the Lord met me halfway and said: “Be of good courage; I make you a fisher of men.” It was for me an Easter Day of humiliation, but also of blessing, and I began to understand the women’s feelings when they went from the tomb with fear; but I also came to understand how they nevertheless went away with great joy.

“Love casts out fear,” says the Apostle. No one knows God’s love except he who has been made to see his sin and in his fear and distress has found grace through faith in the crucified and risen one. Where sin abounded, grace abounded yet more; the deeper one is permitted to press down into his own depth of sin, the more firmly he clings to the Savior, the more he grows in faith, and the more blessedly he feels the joy of being saved. Therefore Paul also says after having lamented: O wretched man that I am! — “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus; for if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him; for death has no more dominion over him; the death that he died, he died once for sin, but the life that he lives, he lives to God.”

If we cannot approach Christ’s opened tomb without fear when we consider our sin and God’s omnipotence and grace, then neither can we ascend to the risen one except with an unspeakable joy, praise and thanksgiving; for he who was dead, behold, he lives; and we who were dead, behold, we live! If he is risen, then we are rising; if he has ascended, then we shall follow after him; and if he sits at the Father’s right hand, then we also shall live and reign with him in all eternity. Precious soul, do you believe this?

O if you must indeed be humbled like Peter and terrified like Mary Magdalene, what unspeakable blessedness to come again early on Easter morning to Jesus’ tomb, and so believe and know that Jesus is risen and you with him, and go from there not only with fear, but also with great joy because of God’s love which is poured out in you by his Holy Spirit!

Then there remains only this: like the women, with the conviction of faith and childlike trust, to go out among brothers and sisters and proclaim this truth, which is eternally alike new and alike powerful: Jesus is risen! He is risen! And as it stands written: “We are buried with him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also shall walk in newness of life” — so begin this Easter morning with earnestness and sincerity, not only with confession of the mouth, but above all with a Christian life, a life in daily fear and poverty of spirit, but also a life in great joy and the overcoming of the flesh, to proclaim first among your own, then to all others, this saving truth — if you yourself have experienced it — “Christ is risen!” From poor sinners, from tried Christians, yes, from the angels in heaven there shall sound back the answer: “He is truly risen.”
