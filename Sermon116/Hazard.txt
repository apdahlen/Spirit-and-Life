STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Aand" – may mean spirit/ghost; must preserve contrast with bodily reality.
* "Kjød og Been" – biblical idiom; must retain corporeal concreteness.
* "Forraadnelse" – corruption/decay; doctrinally tied to Acts 2.
* "Enfoldig" – simple in the sense of undivided, not simplistic.
* "Salig / Salighed" – blessedness/salvation; must retain soteriological depth.
* "Soning" – atonement; substitutionary nuance must remain.
* "Seierherre" – victor; triumph over death.
* "Retfærdighed" – righteousness; forensic resonance.
* "Forkrænkeligt / Uforkrænkelighed" – corruptible/incorruptibility; Pauline vocabulary.
* "Forklarelse" – glorification; eschatological transformation.
* "Udkaarelse" – adoption; Romans 8 terminology.
* "Livsens Haab" – hope of life; eschatological promise.
* "Undergjerningens Mand" – worker of miracles; Christological weight.
* "Stilsmiße" – apparent separation; not true rupture.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long doctrinal accumulations with semicolons.
* Parallel conditional constructions: "Er han død… er han opstanden…"
* Scriptural insertions embedded mid‑argument.
* Rhetorical questioning used catechetically.
* Sermonic progression from narrative to doctrine to exhortation.

Theological Hazards:

* Bodily resurrection as essential to salvation.
* Substitutionary atonement: innocent for guilty.
* Justification by faith in his blood.
* Victory over death as objective event.
* Adoption and redemption of the body.
* Distinction between intellectual religion and saving faith.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone.
* Direct address to conscience: "du".
* Polemic against spiritualizing interpretations.
* Consolation mingled with warning.
* Elevated but not sentimental devotional diction.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Herren er sandelig opstanden" – liturgical Easter acclamation; equivalent to "The Lord is truly risen." Retain declarative force.
* "Hans Sjæl blev ikke forladt i de dødes Rige" – Acts 2:31; echo of Psalm 16; must preserve doctrinal precision.
* "Troede endnu ikke for Glæde" – disbelief overwhelmed by joy; Luke 24:41.
* "Har Helvedes og Dødens Nøgler" – Revelation 1:18; authority imagery.
* "Hvor sig to i Gud samraade" – hymn echo of Matthew 18:20.
* "Aandens Førstegrøde" – firstfruits of the Spirit; Romans 8:23.
* "Udgange fra Døden" – Psalm 68:20; deliverances from death.
* "Guds Billede" – image of God; creation theology.
* Literal rendering required; figurative spiritualization would weaken argument.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening narrative: disciples’ confession.
* Demonstration of difficulty of literal belief.
* Polemic against merely spiritual resurrection.
* Thesis: only bodily resurrection constitutes true Christian faith.
* Soteriological explanation: death as atonement, resurrection as victory.
* Personal application: peace to the sinner.
* Means of encounter: Word and congregation.
* Eschatological expansion: redemption of the body.
* Communal consolation in face of death.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

The Risen Jesus.
First Sunday after Easter.

Luke 24:36–43. But as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them: Peace be with you! Then they were startled and seized with fear, and supposed that they saw a spirit. And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do such thoughts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have. And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. But while they still did not believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them: Have you here anything to eat? And they gave him a piece of broiled fish and of a honeycomb. And he took it and ate before them.

“The Lord is truly risen!” This the eleven already knew and confessed when the two disciples returned from Emmaus and told that they had seen the risen one. For the eleven greeted them at their entrance with this cry, which since then has sounded unceasingly within the congregation of God: “The Lord is truly risen and has been seen by Simon.”

Yet our text shows us how difficult it is to believe wholly and altogether literally that Jesus is truly risen, bodily risen, as Peter later says on the day of Pentecost: “His soul was not left in the realm of the dead, nor did his flesh see corruption.”

For when Jesus himself stood in the midst of the disciples, who had just confessed his resurrection, they were afraid and thought that they saw a spirit. And when Jesus had said: “See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; touch me and see; for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have,” they still did not believe for joy; so that at last Jesus even took a piece of broiled fish and of a honeycomb and ate it before their eyes.

As easily as it is said: “The Lord is truly risen,” so difficult it is therefore to believe it altogether as the words sound. And yet only this is the true and genuine Christian faith.

In our days, and indeed always since the times of Christ, there have been certain very lofty spirits who have readily believed and taught that Christ has spiritually risen from the dead. By this they mean chiefly that his life and work, his suffering and death, have called forth a movement and stirring in the world which has continued until this day and will doubtless continue until the end of the world. Nor indeed can this be denied.

Others again speak more freely and say: Christ has risen in his disciples, in his congregation; the Jews put him to death, but behold, his congregation, which is his body, lives. Nor can this be denied either.

Yet neither of these is the whole, true, Christian faith. It is far simpler, and therefore far more demanding, but therefore also far more blessed. It believes in Jesus Christ crucified, dead, and risen—that is, bodily risen—so that “his soul was not left in the realm of the dead, nor did his flesh see corruption.”

The Christian soul finds its salvation in Jesus himself. His bodily death upon the cross is the atonement for our sins; his bodily resurrection is the mighty testimony that he is the Son of God and the victor over death. If he has died, he who bore our sins, then our sin is atoned for, then there is forgiveness of sins through faith in his blood; if he is risen, then death is overcome, then there is eternal life for sinners through faith in him.

Therefore this is the simple Christian faith which is mighty to make our souls saved: that “Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.”

In this there is salvation for the soul, in nothing else. Not in the understanding’s insight into God’s order of salvation; not in the will’s exertion to improve itself and live a life according to the Lord’s law; not in the feeling’s sorrow and joy. But the living Savior, dead for you and risen for you, the man of mighty deeds, he himself is the Savior, who can say with the power of Spirit and life to your soul: Peace be with you! For he alone has authority over sin and death, because he has suffered, innocent for the guilty, righteous for the unrighteous, and has come forth from grave and hell with victory over them both. Therefore he can forgive sin; therefore he can save from death.

It concerns only this, that you find him himself, who has the keys of hell and of death, who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens. If you find him, then he shall say to you: “Fear not! I am the first and the last and the living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen.” And his peace shall descend into your heart, because in that same moment you know that he is the one who understands all your distress, since he himself has suffered it, and who is mighty to relieve it, since he has gone forth victorious out of suffering.

But where is he to be found? Yes, where did his disciples find him? The two who went to Emmaus, the eleven who were gathered in Jerusalem—where did they find him? It was he who came to them as they went with weeping in their hearts and spoke of his suffering and death. It was he who came to the eleven as they sat frightened behind closed doors with his words and works in remembrance. He came to them. Therefore do not fear, you who long sorely for salvation and peace; he shall come also to you, if you seek him in his Word and in his congregation. It is as it stands in the hymn:

Where two in God take counsel,
There he himself the third;
He makes their counsel open,
And speaks the comforting word.

Or as it stands in another hymn:

See how Jesus everywhere
Is present with each one
Who will inscribe him in the heart
And hold himself near him!
In the midst of the disciples
He lets himself be gloriously seen,
As they, full of sorrow in the hall,
Held of him a sweet discourse.

If you seek him in full earnest, then you shall indeed find that he is truly not far from any of us. You shall find him, and he shall find you, and your soul shall be refreshed by his peace. For he can give you all that you lack. You are sinful; he gives you righteousness. You are mortal; he grants you eternal life. You are lost and condemned; he gives eternal salvation and the hope of life. You bear a corruptible and sensual body; he gives incorruptibility and the glorification of the body. For all that he has won as the Son of Man in glory for his human nature, that he has won in order to give it to us; for he himself had enough in the glory which he had with the Father before the foundation of the world was laid.

Thus it is only the risen Jesus who can be our Savior. What we need is not merely a teacher who can show us the way through life; but a Savior who can show us the way through death. As it is written: “Our God is a God of continual salvation, and to the Lord God belong deliverances from death.” For “we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.” To full salvation belongs also the salvation of the body in incorruptibility; therefore Jesus’ bodily resurrection is so precious a pearl in the wreath which Christian faith possesses. God gave his image in body and soul; he raises it again in both through his Son.

Therefore the believing congregation of God is a blessed fellowship. For when death breaks the brother‑ and sister‑chain with its strong hand, yet it is only an apparent sundering for the eye, not for the heart. For the soul lives, and the body rises by God’s power, which he revealed when he raised Jesus from the dead. Though therefore we stand with tears in our eyes beside bier and grave, yet we sing glad in mind and soul:

Let heart and eye then break,
And body laid in coffin lie,
The hour shall not be far away
When he shall call it back to life.

By death from all distress set free,
The bodies mingle with the dust,
But glorious they shall rise again,
With life‑breath and with beauty filled.

The Lord be praise and glory for the resurrection and the hope of resurrection. May we all do as Paul: “Forgetting what lies behind and reaching forth to what lies ahead, I press toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”
