STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Sandhedens Aand” — carries Johannine theological weight (John 14–16); must be rendered “Spirit of Truth,” not generalized as “true spirit.”
* “Talsmand” — traditional rendering “Comforter” (KJV) or “Advocate”; must preserve forensic and consolatory force.
* “annamme” — archaic for “receive”; not merely intellectual acceptance but spiritual reception.
* “Mægleren” — “Mediator,” doctrinally precise (1 Tim. 2:5).
* “Skinet” — mere appearance or semblance; not light but outward show.
* “Hengivelsen” — surrender/devotion; moral-spiritual yielding.
* “Forkrænkelighed / forkrænkelige Ting” — perishable, corruptible; Pauline resonance.
* “Fortabelsen” — perdition, not mere ruin.
* “Syndernes Forladelse” — forgiveness of sins; fixed doctrinal phrase.
* “Delagtig” — partaker; participation language (2 Pet. 1:4 resonance).
* “Guds Billede” — image of God; must retain creation–restoration theology.
* “Samfund” — fellowship/communion; not casual association.
* “Menighed” — congregation/church; theological body of Christ.
* “Skikkelse” — form/visible shape; incarnation-like resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended sermonic sentences with causal progression (“Thi… derfor…”).
* Parallel contrasts: World vs. Jesus; Truth vs. Lie; Life vs. Death.
* Embedded Scripture quotations.
* Rhetorical questions escalating in moral force.
* Accumulated metaphors in sequences (spring, morning, dew, rain).

Theological Hazards:

* Union with Christ (“I i mig, og jeg i eder”).
* Image of God restored in Christ.
* Life vs. death as ontological realities.
* World as spiritual power opposed to God (Johannine sense).
* Pentecost as living ecclesial reality, not memorial.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortations (“Elsk Jesus!”) must retain imperative urgency.
* Address to the soul (“o Sjæl”) — intimate, pastoral tone.
* Severe warnings about eternal hunger and death.
* Corporate appeal to awaken as Church.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Ild i Torne” — allusion to Ecclesiastes 7:6 (“crackling of thorns under a pot”); fleeting, noisy flame.
* “Den fortabte Søn… Svinemad” — Luke 15; heightens shame and degradation.
* “Verden forgaar med dens Lyst” — 1 John 2:17.
* “Tro paa hans Navn og elske hverandre” — 1 John 3:23.
* “Samfund i Lyset” — 1 John 1:7.
* “Det gamle er forbigangent…” — 2 Cor. 5:17.
* Pentecost as “Fødselstime” — Acts 2 ecclesiology.
* Final quotation — Isaiah 52:1–2.

Literal renderings would obscure force if flattened (e.g., “Skinet” merely as “shadow”); must retain moral exposure.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening doctrinal thesis: Jesus is Truth and Life; therefore the Spirit is Spirit of Truth and Life.
* Anthropological claim: Life without Jesus is life without God.
* Moral exposure: Life in the world is life in lie and self-deception.
* Eschatological warning: Eternal hunger and death.
* Christological turn: Love to Jesus as participation in truth and life.
* Pneumatological work: Spirit unveils sin and reveals Savior.
* Doctrinal summary: Christ from Father, to world, back to Father.
* Restoration of Image of God.
* Experiential promise: indwelling communion.
* Ecclesial exhortation: Pentecost renewed among us.
* Prophetic climax: Isaiah call to Zion.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 14:15–21 (primary text).
* 1 Timothy 2:5 (Mediator).
* Luke 15 (Prodigal Son).
* 1 John 2:17; 3:23; 1:7.
* 2 Corinthians 5:17.
* Acts 2 (Pentecost).
* Isaiah 52:1–2.
* Ecclesiastes 7:6.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain direct address and warnings.
* Preserve inevitability of consequence (eternal hunger, death).
* Maintain solemn pastoral earnestness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skal” rendered “shall,” preserving certainty.
* Imperatives retained (“Love Jesus!” “Awake!”).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Sandhed — Truth.
* Liv — Life.
* Verden — World.
* Aand — Spirit.
* Guds Billede — Image of God.
* Samfund — fellowship.
* Menighed — Church.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fire in thorns retained.
* Hunger and thirst imagery preserved.
* Seasonal metaphors preserved in sequence.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Sharp contrast between perdition and blessedness.
* Severity followed by consolation and promise.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long cumulative sentences preserved.
* Repetition (“Love Jesus!”) maintained.
* Prophetic crescendo at conclusion.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The Spirit of Truth.

First Day of Pentecost.

John 14:15–21. If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Advocate, that he may abide with you forever, the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, for it neither sees him nor knows him; but you know him, for he abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you fatherless; I come to you. Yet a little while, and the World sees me no more, but you see me; for I live, and you shall live. On that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me; and he who loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I shall love him and manifest myself to him.

Jesus is the Truth and the Life; therefore the Spirit whom he sends is the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Life.

A human life without Jesus and the Spirit of Jesus is a life without God; for Jesus alone is the Mediator between God and men; therefore it is only through Jesus that we can receive Life and Spirit from God.

Therefore a human life without Jesus is a life without Truth, a life in lie. You seem to live, yet you do not live in Truth. There remains only the semblance of that life which God gave the man he had created. Instead of fellowship with the eternal Fountain of Life, the heavenly Father, there has come surrender to the World with its vain desire, which burns with hasty flame like a fire in thorns. What is this but deceit and lie, when man seeks to satisfy the hunger and thirst of his immortal soul with the perishable things of the World? It is more offensive than the prodigal son who filled his belly with swine’s food.

In lie lives he who sinks an immortal soul down into the perishableness of the World. Therefore he gains only death thereby. In a little while he is separated from the World and the World from him, and eternal hunger and thirst become the lot of the soul, if through ages of ages it has nothing but the consuming longing after the perishable and sensual things which are no more to be had.

Therefore, if you love the World, you deceive yourself; for the World passes away with its desire; and when the World is gone, what then have you to love? There remains for you only the eternal emptiness, which is rightly called the eternal torment and the eternal death.

But Jesus is the Truth and the Life. And as the soul is united with the World when it loves the World, so also love to Jesus is the way to become partaker of his Truth and his Life.

Love Jesus! You know well how this may take place. For he has loved you first and has given his life for you upon the Cross. He has stretched out his arms and hands toward you and said: Come to me, you poor, sinful man, I will give you forgiveness of sins and rest for your soul. If you have cast yourself into his arms and found peace with God, then you have learned to love him who drew you up out of perdition and gave you eternal salvation.

Love Jesus! It consists in keeping his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous, for it is this: to believe in his Name and love one another, as he commanded us.

If this love of Jesus is in you, then you are partaker of his Spirit, who is the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Life. He who loves the World receives the spirit of the World. He who loves Jesus receives the Spirit of Jesus. It is the mighty Spirit of Truth who tears away from our soul the deceit of sin and shows us the abyss of perdition which hides itself behind the smiling mask of sinful desire. It is the Spirit of Truth who lets the soul see the terror of sin, yet also points to him who is the Savior of sins, and who shows us all the way to the Father’s heart and lets us taste eternal Life from the eternal Fountain of Life.

For this is the Truth, the eternal, life-giving Truth, which the heart appropriates only by the Spirit of Truth: that Jesus has gone forth from the Father and come into the World; and he has left the World again and gone to the Father; he came with Life from God to a race of men who had lost the Life of God; he returned to the Father in order to lead those whom he saved into eternal glory. The regained and restored and given-back Image of God — this is God’s Truth in Jesus Christ and in us through the Spirit of Jesus.

Therefore the Spirit of Truth is also the Spirit of Life. “I live, and you shall live,” says Jesus. The same Spirit who is the Spirit of Truth, and whom the World does not know because it lives in the deceit of sin, the same Spirit is also the Spirit of Life. For if the Truth is the Image of God renewed in our hearts, then this is Life, that we become children of God when the Father’s Image is impressed upon our soul.

Love Jesus! and you are partaker of his Spirit; the Truth shall shine into your heart, and the Life shall penetrate your whole being. The old has passed away, and all has become new by the Spirit of Truth.

On that day you shall experience that Jesus is in the Father, and you in him and he in you. Then you have fellowship in the Light with the Father and the Son by the Holy Spirit. Your soul, which has gone forth from God, has found its way back to him; and you are blessed in the fellowship of love with God.

It is your Pentecost day, O soul. It is as gentle and blessed spring after long winter. It is as the clear morning after black night. It is as lovely dew upon dry field, as refreshing rain after drought. Blessed is he whose life has had such a Pentecost day.

It is time, friends, for us to awake and arise from sleep, that it may be known of us as children of the Light that the night is now past.

We celebrate Pentecost, which is the birth-hour of God’s Church upon earth. Shall it be for us only a dead memory of long-vanished greatness? O no, let us awake as is right, and give the Spirit room in our hearts, each one and all together, and then God’s Church shall again take form among us, the Body of Jesus Christ again receive its growth among us, the Bride of Jesus again be adorned for her heavenly Bridegroom.

Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. Shake yourself from the dust, arise, sit upon your throne, O Jerusalem; loose yourself from the bonds of your neck, you captive daughter of Zion.

Long enough has the glory of God’s Church been dimmed among us; step forth again in the strength of the Spirit and new Life from God. Then there shall be new Pentecost upon earth, and your light shall shine unto the ends of the World.
