STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Bekjendelse” — not merely “confession” in a psychological sense, but doctrinal confession, public avowal of faith.
* “Menighed” — congregation or Church; must retain ecclesial weight, not merely “community.”
* “Kjød og Blod” — biblical idiom (flesh and blood) meaning human capacity; must retain Scriptural resonance.
* “Aabenbarelse” — revelation in the theological sense, divine disclosure.
* “Salig” — blessed in eschatological and salvific sense, not merely happy.
* “Fordervelse og Fortabelse” — corruption and perdition; strong soteriological weight.
* “Sønderknuselse” — spiritual brokenness, contrition.
* “Naadestolen” — mercy seat; strong Old Testament cultic echo.
* “Binde og løse” — technical rabbinic and ecclesial authority language; must retain juridical-spiritual force.
* “Enfoldige” — simple in the sense of spiritually simple, not naïve.
* “Redskaber” — instruments; must not weaken to vague metaphor.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences accumulating theological reasoning.
* Parallel constructions (e.g., binding and loosing; Father and Son movement).
* Rhetorical questions addressed directly to the hearer.
* Escalating cadence toward climactic doctrinal affirmations.
* Semicolon logic that must not be broken into flattened modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Christological confession: “Kristus, den levende Guds Søn.”
* Doctrine of revelation from the Father.
* Regeneration and adoption (“Guds Barn”).
* Authority of the keys.
* Sin as corruption and perdition.
* Conscience awakened by Christ’s holiness.
* Indwelling life: “du lever og jeg lever i dig.”

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation to the individual conscience.
* Severity concerning sin and perdition.
* Solemn ecclesial authority language.
* Avoiding sentimentalization of spiritual experience.
* Maintaining sermonic gravity and inevitability of consequence.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Menneskens Søn” — Son of Man; clear biblical title (Matthew 16). Must retain Christological dignity.
* “Kjød og Blod” — Matthew 16:17; human nature unaided by grace.
* “Helvedes Porte” — gates of hell (Matthew 16:18).
* “Himmeriges Riges Nøgler” — keys of the kingdom of heaven.
* “Binde og løse” — Matthew 16:19; juridical authority.
* “Naadestolen” — mercy seat (Romans 3:25 echo; Hebrews imagery).
* “Uden Gud og uden Kristus” — echo of Ephesians 2:12.
* “Intet andet Navn givet under Himlene” — Acts 4:12.
* “Ja og Amen” — 2 Corinthians 1:20 resonance.
* “Umyndiges og diendes Mund” — Psalm 8:2.

Literal translation risks obscuring force where idioms carry covenantal or judicial weight; these must retain biblical density.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening: Jesus asks for fruit of his words and works.
* Division: humanity vs. disciples.
* Central thesis: The question “Who am I?” is life-and-eternity question.
* Examination of popular answers: conscience awakened but incomplete.
* Explanation: Christ as true and perfect Man exposes sin.
* Pivot: Peter’s confession grounded in experience and revelation.
* Threefold exposition of Jesus’ response:

  * Revelation from the Father.
  * Confession makes confessor a pillar.
  * Authority of the keys.
* Final exhortation and blessing.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 16:13–19 (primary text).
* Luke 5:8 (Peter: “I am a sinful man”).
* Romans 10:10 (confession unto salvation).
* Psalm 8:2.
* Acts 4:12.
* Ephesians 2:12.
* 2 Corinthians 1:20.
* Hebrews 9 (mercy seat imagery).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain direct address: “Friend…”
* Preserve sharp contrasts: sin vs. glory; bondage vs. freedom.
* No softening of perdition language.
* Maintain gravity of ecclesial authority.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “Skulle ikke faa Overhaand” — shall not prevail.
* “Maa grunde sig” — must be grounded.
* “Bør standse” — ought to stop.
* Preserve necessity and inevitability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Bekjendelse — confession.
* Menighed — Church.
* Aabenbarelse — revelation.
* Salig — blessed.
* Frelse — salvation.
* Baand — bonds.
* Frihed — freedom.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Crown and image of God retained.
* Sword in the heart.
* Rock and pillar imagery.
* Keys imagery preserved fully.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward sin.
* Consolation for believers.
* Authority and blessing intertwined.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve extended sentences where reasoning accumulates.
* Maintain rhetorical repetition (“Who am I?”).
* Keep climactic blessing intact.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Peter’s Confession.

Fifth Sunday after Trinity.

Matthew 16:13–19.

In this text we are told how Jesus asks for fruit of his words and works. Yet he divides those to whom he directs his question into two classes. He first asks what the people say, and then what the disciples say. He expects a better answer from the latter, and he receives it. But in both cases the question is the same: Who do they say that I am? Or more briefly: Who am I? This, therefore, is his true question to all. This is also the question of life and the question of eternity for each one of us. Here is the place where every human soul on earth ought to pause and consider: Who is Jesus? What do I know of him, not according to memorized books and discourses, but according to my own personal experience?

Have you ever attempted to give an honest answer to this question? If you have not, then test yourself now and answer for yourself and before God how matters stand with your personal knowledge of Jesus of Nazareth. What do you say of him; what has he been and what is he for you?

It is remarkable to hear what the people said about the Son of Man. When Jesus says: What do the people say of me, who am the Son of Man, then it is surely his meaning that people ought to know the Son of Man. He, the true Man who is born into the world, ought not to be unknown and a stranger among men. Him they ought to recognize again, just as a mother knows her son, even if he has been away ever so long; just as precious memories of childhood rise again upon the soil of home when we tread it once more after long, long absence.

But the people did not know the Son of Man. And yet, when they call him John the Baptist or Elijah or Jeremiah, it is clear enough that this wondrous Son of Man nevertheless is mighty to awaken the human conscience. There stirred within them a consciousness that here they stood face to face with a man who brought them to think of sin and the Fall and departed glory. For what are John the Baptist and Elijah and Jeremiah but the mightiest voices of repentance that have sounded in the human race? Of them people must think when they see and hear Jesus of Nazareth. His appearing is such that they involuntarily must feel that their sin separates them from him and from God, that their sin is their corruption and perdition. From where can this come, that Jesus’ quiet and blessed activity awakens such thoughts? Why do people hear in his speech a voice of judgment that brings them to remember their sin? It comes from this, that he is what we ought to be, but are not. It comes from this, that the Son of Man is true Man, perfect Man, a Man who still bears the crown that belonged to man from the beginning; he still has the image of God which we have lost. Therefore consciences awaken wherever Jesus draws near; therefore his most gracious words and works are felt as strong testimonies of sin, as powerful reminders of a glory which once was ours, but is no more. Every feature of his life becomes a sharp sword in the heart of the one who loves sin and lives in it.

But when Jesus then turns to the disciples and asks them: But you, who do you say that I am? then there is one of them who can answer rightly. It is he who once in his fishing boat had fallen down at Jesus’ feet and cried: Lord, depart from me; for I am a sinful man. Simon, son of Jonah, had experienced the same as those people who had come into contact with Jesus; and with Simon it had become a complete and full brokenness and surrender, so that Jesus had also raised him up and made him a new man. Therefore he knew Jesus better and altogether differently than the people; he could answer with rock‑firm faith: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. That was the sum of Peter’s spiritual experience. He could utter the word which no human mouth had yet uttered upon earth. It is an overwhelmingly mighty and powerful word; therefore it also receives from Jesus an even mightier answer: Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah; for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I also say to you, that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

Thus has no human being ever spoken. And indeed one might think and write about each of these words without ever reaching the bottom of them. They have also in the history of the Church, through misinterpretation and misuse, acquired a quite particular influence which would well be worth illuminating more closely. But we must here confine ourselves to what is most essential. And then above all there are three things to observe in these words of Jesus to Simon, which are as serious and as edifying for every other true confessor as for him who first heard them from Jesus.

The first is this, that the right and true confession of Jesus is not wrought by flesh and blood, but is a revelation from the Father who is in heaven. Flesh and blood signifies all human ability and human power of whatever name it may be called, whether learning or acuteness, thinking or feeling. It all does not suffice. The confession unto salvation of which Jesus here speaks, and of which Paul testifies in the Epistle to the Romans, must be grounded in revelation from the Father in heaven. When we learn from the Father to go to the Son and from the Son to go to the Father, and thus driven to the cross and drawn to the mercy seat find peace with God and become his children, then only do we rightly know by personal experience and by God’s revelation that Jesus, the crucified and risen one, is the Son of the living God. Then we can confess with the mouth unto salvation.

Friend, has it gone thus with you? Have you come to the Son drawn and driven by the Father; and have you come to the Father lovingly led by the Son? Have you received the witness of the Spirit in your heart that you are a child of God, then you can confess with joy like Simon, son of Jonah: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God; you live and I live in you.

The second is this, that the genuine and true confession of Jesus also makes every confessor a rock and pillar in God’s Church. As Simon, son of Jonah, became Peter through his confession and his testimony, so also shall everyone who confesses Jesus to be the Savior, the Christ, the Son of the living God, become a pillar of the truth and a foundation upon earth; and though the storms of hell rage about this rock, they shall nevertheless not be able to overthrow it. Out of the mouth of infants and nursing children the Lord prepares praise and power upon earth, when they with stammering tongue confess Jesus to be the Savior. And this heavenly wisdom, which is hidden from the wise and understanding of the earth, is the Church’s firm and invincible defense against hell’s wickedness and falsehood. This truth prevails at last; blessed is the one who has built upon it in life, for it shall not fail him in death.

The third is this, that the true confessor of Jesus Christ receives the keys of the kingdom of heaven to bind and to loose upon earth, so that it also is bound and loosed in heaven. It is a wondrous word and a wondrous power. It is the glorious power of God’s liberated children; who can rightly describe it? They themselves are Christ’s bound ones and yet Christ’s freed ones, thus they know both bonds and freedom. They belong to Christ, that is their only bond; they are delivered out of the bondage of sin and of the world and of Satan, that is their freedom. Therefore they also can bind and loose with the imperishable keys of the kingdom of heaven. They can testify to the one who without God and without Christ tosses about in the life of the world and of sin, that there is no salvation in any other, and that there is no other name given under heaven by which we must be saved, except the name of Jesus alone. That is the bond which binds heaven and earth together, and with which every heart must be bound that shall be saved. It is a key of the kingdom of heaven which opens and no one shuts, which shuts and no one opens. And the heaven of heavens shall answer Yes and Amen to this bond. They can also testify to all those who seek salvation in this name, that there is freedom and blessed release from all the bonds of sin and of judgment and of hell in this name of Jesus; and that again is a key of the kingdom of heaven, to which Father, Son, and Holy Spirit shall bear witness in heaven that it is faithful and true. And through the simple testimony of the true confessors human hearts shall be bound and human hearts loosed, and only the Lord’s own Day shall fully reveal what has been bound and loosed through the simple confession of the name of Jesus from believing human lips.

Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, and blessed is everyone who confesses that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. May the Lord himself awaken in our hearts the true and living faith and place the testimony and the confession upon our lips, that we might become instruments to bind and to loose upon earth in Jesus’ name, so that it also might be bound and loosed in heaven.
