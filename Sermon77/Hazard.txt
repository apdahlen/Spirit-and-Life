* Vantro – unbelief, not mere doubt; spiritual resistance.
* Forbarm dig – mercy grounded in divine compassion.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermon sentences with causal chains and rhetorical escalation.
* Frequent semicolon logic reflecting oral proclamation.
* Embedded Scripture woven into exhortation.

Theological Hazards:

Father and Son.

Second Sunday in Lent.

Mark 9:17–29. And one of the crowd answered and said, “Teacher, I brought my son to you; he has a mute spirit. And whenever it seizes him, it tears him, and he foams and grinds his teeth and wastes away; and I spoke to your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not.” But he answered them and said, “O unbelieving generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.” And they brought him to him; and when he saw him, the spirit immediately convulsed him, and he fell to the ground and rolled about, foaming. And he asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood. And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have mercy on us and help us.” But Jesus said to him, “If you can believe— all things are possible for the one who believes.” Immediately the child’s father cried out, weeping, and said, “I believe, Lord! Help my unbelief!” And when Jesus saw that the crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You mute and deaf spirit, I command you: come out of him and enter him no more!” And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out; and he became like one dead, so that many said, “He is dead.” But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up, and he stood up. And when he had gone into a house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” And he said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except prayer and fasting.”

A father whose only son is mute and grievously afflicted by an evil spirit is the one who, according to our text, finds the way to Jesus and has his son healed by him. It is just like the Canaanite woman whose daughter was sorely vexed by the devil and who wrestled with Jesus until he helped her against the fury of the devil.

This father in our text is a true example for all God-fearing fathers among us. He shows the simple and only way to fight against the power of the devil in our houses and homes.

There are many fathers who imagine that they will manage the matter well enough themselves. They will surely raise their children so that they become good and upright and perhaps even God-fearing; their children are so different from all other children— with them there is no danger; and when they in addition receive a good upbringing, they will surely become their parents’ joy and honor and the support of their old age.

But what can you accomplish, O human being, against the power of the devil? And how many proud and self-satisfied fathers have not had to hide their faces in shame over their children’s misery, when sin and the world and the devil have taken power over them and cast them down into the depths of sin and into the disgrace of vice! And how many mothers have not had to feel the bitterness of the old saying, that “the small strike the rod, the grown strike the heart.”

Is there any deliverance from this distress? Is there any remedy for this pain?

Yes, the Gospel of God shows the way— indeed a heavy and narrow way for father and mother, yet a way that leads forward.

It is a way upon which the self-seeking, self-willed, and proud father does not walk. For as long as someone seeks only his own honor and his own advantage in his child’s goodness and uprightness, the Gospel of God cannot help him. He takes the responsibility upon himself, and he must also take the consequences upon himself.

But the unhappy father in our text shows the way. For he comes with his son to Jesus and says, “Teacher, I have brought my son to you.”

Behold, here is the way you must go if you truly intend to fight the power of the devil in your child. Your refined and careful upbringing is of no use. Something else and something mightier is required. You must follow Jesus’ gracious command: “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.”

Have you considered this, that with all your careful upbringing you may perhaps be standing in the way of your little child, so that it does not come to Jesus? Or is it not with many of our educators as it was with the Pharisees, who cleansed the outside of cups and dishes and polished them bright for their own pleasure and pride; but beneath all that outward polishing and adornment the heart remains full of wickedness and deceit?

The one who would see his child saved begins by loving his child, loving its soul, instead of loving himself. The one who seeks his own when he raises his child, he shall receive his own again. But the one who in sincerity seeks his child’s salvation and eternal good, he goes to Jesus with his child and for his child.

Do you do this? Can you in truth say to Jesus, “Teacher, I have brought my child to you?”

It is a daily humiliation for the vain father’s heart to have to go to Jesus and say with the unhappy father in our text: “If you can do anything, have mercy on us and help us!” For in this lies the full acknowledgment of our own impotence in the face of the evil whose powers stir in our children’s hearts. How utterly different is this deep humiliation from the pride with which our hearts rejoice over the outward refinement that our own carefulness can produce in our children! Wretched hypocrites that we are; we point with pride to our well-behaved children, and we think in our hearts: I thank you, God, that they are not like other people’s children— disobedient, stubborn, unclean, thieving, vicious, and corrupt. The Lord will say to us: You servant, you have strained out the gnat and swallowed the camel; your child looks better before people and in your own eyes, but God looks at the heart, and its uncleanness and wickedness you have not touched, nor do you have power to do anything about it.

Therefore guard yourself, friend, lest you forget the heart for the sake of outward conduct, and neglect your child’s soul while you labor for its temporal happiness. Go deeper and ask whether you can also do something for your child’s eternal blessedness, and then fall humbly at Jesus’ feet and acknowledge that you can do nothing, and say to him in heartfelt simplicity and sincerity: “But if you can do anything, have mercy on us and help us!”

Yet you are not finished. The hardest still remains. Jesus will answer you as he answered the unhappy father with the sick son: “If you can believe— all things are possible for the one who believes.” It is as if he were saying: Certainly I am able to help; but are you also able to believe?

It is therefore of no use to go to Jesus with an empty confession of the mouth, nor to seek him with a heart full of sheer despair. You must indeed despair of your own power, but not of his power. You must acknowledge your impotence, but you must in faith entrust yourself to him with your whole heart.

Oh, if we could answer like this weeping father: “I believe, Lord! Help my unbelief!” Then our child’s distress would truly become our distress, when it dawned upon us with the Lord’s light and clarity that we ourselves needed his help just as much as our child. We needed faith just as much as our child needed help; and the distress and sorrow and anxiety would become a blessing for both father and child.

Is it then truly true that all things are possible for the one who believes?

Yes— it is precisely here that our unbelief shows itself. We do not believe God all the way; we do not believe the Savior fully on his word. Lord, Lord, help our unbelief!

And this is the new humiliation that only the Christian heart knows, because it alone knows what pain it is to experience that it does not believe, when it so dearly wishes to believe. Yet even this humiliation must be accepted by the one who would prevail in the struggle with Jesus for his child’s soul. Do not think: I am a believer, and my children will surely become believers when I train and raise them. Oh no; but go to Jesus, and when he looks at you and says: Do you believe? then let it become for you a moment of self-examination and humiliation, in which you truly confess and pray: “Help my unbelief!”

Then you shall receive faith from God, who gives generously and without reproach. And you shall receive more: the devil shall be driven out of your child and shall afflict it no longer.

Can then a Christian’s child be lost?
A dreadful question! A child is not saved because it is a Christian’s child. But a child is saved if a Christian father truly brings it with him to Jesus and obtains help for the child.

If Christian parents truly did this in earnestness and simplicity, then not so many Christian hearts would sigh and lament over wayward children.

It is true, a child does not always remain a child. The time comes when it is no longer a child, and when it can give the devil room despite parents’ prayers and intercessions. Christian father and mother, do not wait until that time to carry your child on the arm of prayer and faith to the Savior. It may be that then it is too late! It is while your child is still a child that you can let it come to Jesus, that he may take it in his arms and bless it.

If you do this, you people of God, then God-fearing fathers shall raise God-fearing sons, and the Lord’s blessing shall rest upon house and home.

Oh, that the Lord would lay something of his seriousness and his Spirit into the hearts of the many young married couples who have sons and daughters in this land, so that they would in time go to the Savior for their children and with their children. Truly, they would spare themselves bitter tears in their old age, and they would bind their children’s souls to themselves, so that by the Lord’s grace it would be granted them to say: “Here am I and the children whom you have given me.”
