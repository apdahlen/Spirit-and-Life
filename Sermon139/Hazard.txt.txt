STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Frygter” used not in the sense of reverential fear but of being afraid; must distinguish from “fear of God” as worship.
* “Menneskens Søn” — Christological title; must remain “the Son of Man.”
* “Helvede” — Hell in eschatological sense; not metaphorical ruin.
* “Helligeaand” — Holy Spirit; doctrinal precision required.
* “Synde mod Aanden” — sin against the Spirit; technical theological category (unforgivable sin).
* “Farisæernes Surdeig” — leaven of the Pharisees; metaphor requiring preservation.
* “Tjenstsalighed” — likely “hypocrisy” or false piety; must preserve doctrinal nuance.
* “Samvittighedsrørelse” — stirring of conscience; inward trembling.
* “Syndefordærving” — corruption through sin; not mere wrongdoing.
* “Benaadet Sjæl” — soul that has received grace.
* “Forjættelse” — promise in biblical covenantal sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended sermonic sentences with accumulative logic and semicolon pivots.
* Repeated imperatives (“Frygter… Frygter ikke… Bekjend…”) forming rhetorical cadence.
* Embedded Scripture quotations requiring structural retention.
* Parallel exhortations and triadic structures (first, second, third encouragement).
* Rhetorical questions addressing the conscience directly.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between bodily death and eternal destruction of soul.
* Doctrine of confession before men and Christ’s confession before the Father.
* Work of the Holy Spirit in conviction and testimony.
* Reality of eternal damnation and unforgivable sin.
* Spiritual warfare: Satan’s deception and corruption of conscience.
* Justification through Christ’s atoning death (“Jesu Blod”).
* Eternal reward: reigning with Christ.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest warning against false fear and hypocrisy.
* Direct address: “Ven” implicating the hearer.
* Moral urgency without sentimentality.
* Pastoral warmth combined with severity.
* Avoid smoothing rhetorical repetition or reducing intensity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Det Suk, der gaar gjennem Naturen (Rom. 8, 22)” — alludes to Romans 8:22 (creation groaning); indicates cosmic fallenness affecting human soul.
* “Farisæernes Surdeig” — Luke 12:1; leaven as hidden permeating corruption; hypocrisy.
* “Synde mod Aanden” — Matthew 12:31–32; blasphemy against the Holy Spirit; final hardness.
* “Frygt ikke, du Orm Jakob” — Isaiah 41:14; covenantal consolation.
* “Du lille Hjorde” — Luke 12:32; pastoral image.
* “Tegnet paa sine Hænder” — Isaiah 49:16; engraved on palms.
* “Blandt Røvere faldne” — Luke 10:30; Good Samaritan imagery.
* “Hvad gavner det et Menneske…” — Mark 8:36–38; eschatological warning.

Literal translation would obscure force in:

* “vove sig ved Ord eller Liv” — to risk oneself in word or life; existential exposure.
* “en for Kristus forbandet Ting” — echo of Romans 9:3; willingness to be accursed for others’ salvation.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening clarification of “fear.”
* Anthropology: fear and shame after the Fall.
* Distortion of conscience among pagans and modern men.
* Concrete example of worldly fear leading to crime.
* Transition to Christian peril: silencing Spirit’s witness.
* Doctrinal exposition: confession as cooperation with Spirit.
* Warning: first step toward sin against the Spirit.
* Christ’s pastoral instruction: fear only the one who destroys soul.
* Negative command: do not fear men.
* Positive command: confess Christ.
* Threefold encouragement:

  1. Gratitude to crucified Savior.
  2. God’s protecting care.
  3. Eternal reward of being confessed by Christ.
* Concluding direct appeal and Scriptural reinforcement.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 12:4–12 — primary text.
* Romans 8:22 — creation groaning.
* Romans 1:23 — idolatry.
* John 15:26–27 — Spirit testifying.
* Matthew 12:31–32 — blasphemy against Spirit.
* Isaiah 41:14; 49:16 — covenant comfort.
* Luke 12:32 — little flock.
* Luke 10:30 — man among robbers.
* Mark 8:36–38 — profit and loss of soul.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain stark contrast between temporal shame and eternal ruin.
* Preserve repeated imperatives.
* Keep rhetorical questions sharp and implicating.
* Allow warnings about damnation to stand unsoftened.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “Skulle” — shall / are to.
* “Maa” — must.
* “Kan ei” — cannot.
* Imperatives retained as commands, not suggestions.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Holy Spirit (consistent).
* Confess / confession (for “bekjende”).
* Sin against the Spirit (fixed expression).
* Leaven of the Pharisees (unchanged metaphor).
* Damnation / eternal destruction (stable terminology).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Leaven retained.
* Engraved on hands retained.
* Worm Jacob retained.
* Bearing witness preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severe warning balanced with covenant consolation.
* Shift from doctrinal exposition to intimate appeal (“Friend”).

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve accumulative clauses and semicolon pivots.
* Retain repetition: “Fear… Fear not… Confess…”

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Fear! Fear not!

Sixth Sunday after Easter.

Luke 12:4–12.

But I say to you, my friends: Fear not those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do. But I will show you whom you shall fear: Fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into Hell. Yes, I say to you: Fear him! Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered; therefore fear not! You are of more worth than many sparrows. And I say to you: Everyone who confesses me before men, him shall also the Son of Man confess before the angels of God. But he who denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God. And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven. And when they bring you before synagogues and rulers and authorities, be not anxious how or what you shall answer in your defense, or what you shall say; for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.

The word to fear is used in this passage not in the sense of cherishing reverence, of rendering worship, as when we say to fear God, but simply in the sense of being afraid, of harboring anxiety and dread.

Fear, as well as shame, since the Fall has become a part of human nature. The sigh that passes through creation pierces also the human soul with bodily fear and spiritual anguish, like Cain. The purpose of this stirring of conscience, which like a trembling moves the innermost being of man, was to drive him with blush and humiliation to God, to cry for grace. This impulse is traceable even among the wildest heathen.

But as men in their corruption through sin and under the continued influence of the devilish powers have perverted all things, so we find also that the heathen exchanged the incorruptible God for an image made like corruptible man and even birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things, and in their anguish bent the knee and brought atoning sacrifices to these self-made gods.

So it is this day. What men ought not to fear, that they fear; and they make light of the things for which they ought to bear the most serious anxiety. See, here is a young man who has risen into high and wealthy society, where his vanity is flattered, his abilities and riches praised. His affairs, however, are declining without anyone yet knowing it; it will not be possible for him to maintain his brilliant position without becoming a deceiver. What shall he do? If he openly confesses his condition, he knows that laughter and contempt will be his portion, and that his friends will turn their backs upon him. He cannot endure this thought; he fears this open and honest course more than death and chooses crime. For a short time he still enjoys, as in a frenzy, the brief glitter of self-regard, until all collapses, and he does not truly come to himself until he sits in prison and punishment.

It is but one of a thousand examples which everyone has occasion to observe in all the fields of life, in small as in great, and not least in one’s own deceitful heart. It is a devilish distortion of the voice of conscience, which daily and abundantly presses itself even into the life of the Christian. And in truth, it is there above all other places that Satan gladly would do harm.

Therefore the Lord speaks these warning words to his disciples. A disciple of Christ has to confess. No one knows the Father except through the Son, and no one can call Jesus Lord except by the Holy Spirit. But it is the work of the Holy Spirit to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, in order that men should not die in their sin but turn and live; therefore Jesus says that when the Comforter comes, he shall testify of me; and you also shall testify.

So it is. All the testimony of the Holy Spirit is through men; therefore he takes up dwelling in a human heart, that this heart, by the same word through which it itself has been born again, should testify of the Father and the Son. To testify together with the Holy Spirit concerning the truth of the Gospel, that is to confess Jesus before men. To keep silent about or to distort such testimony, and thus to act against the conviction of God’s Spirit in the heart, that is the first step toward sinning against the Spirit; it is for the Christian the first step back toward an eternal perdition. Therefore it is so dreadful, and therefore the Lord so earnestly warns his disciples against it; for it is precisely what Satan desires, what he works at day and night, to cause the Christian to keep silent about or distort or even deny the testimony of God’s Spirit before men; then he gains a complete dominion and produces what Jesus in the first verse of this chapter calls the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

And to this the disciples are exposed: to fear men more than Satan and his seduction.

Jesus knew that the disciples would have to step forth before men with that same testimony for which he himself must suffer the death of reproach upon the cross. He knew that they should stand before synagogues and rulers and those who have authority, that shame and persecution, indeed death, would be their portion; and he knew that they were weak and might come to fear those who have power to kill them, as they themselves fled in Gethsemane. Therefore he opens their eyes to what they should fear and what they should not fear; he knew their deceitful heart.

Fear only one, he says; fear him who can destroy your souls, penetrate you with the leaven of the Pharisees, and drive you to sin against the Spirit, for which there is no forgiveness either in this world or in the one to come. Fear him!

But fear not men; at the most they can kill the bodies, which in any case one day must die; more they cannot do. Let yourselves therefore not by fear of men be driven away from that which God in heaven requires of you: that you let the Spirit bear witness through you of sin and righteousness and judgment, of grace and love and eternal salvation, that soul after soul may be saved; confess me before men!

Yet if the Lord’s word concerning Satan’s seduction and concerning eternal condemnation should be warning enough against the dreadful danger of acting, in small as in great, against the conviction of God’s Spirit and failing to confess Jesus before men, there is in the Lord’s word to the disciples also a glorious and heavenly encouragement to lay aside all false fear and unafraid step forth with the testimony in word and life before men.

First: how should he for whom Jesus was crucified, who has heard his cry of anguish upon the cross, and through the Holy Spirit and a living faith knows that Jesus has paid for all his sins, how should such a graced soul be able to deny the Lord, his Savior, this one request: Confess me before men! and fear not?

Second: is not the Lord strong enough to defend and protect his own both against men and against the devil? Fear not, you worm Jacob, you little flock of Israel! Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom! He who numbers your hairs and cares for the little sparrows, should he forget you, whom he has engraved upon his hands? Therefore: Confess Jesus before men and fear not!

Finally, third: if there is an eternal danger of damnation in keeping silent about and denying Jesus before men, then there is—strange to say—a reward, an eternal, heavenly reward, for those who fulfill his loving request to us: to confess him before men. For he says that he will then confess them before the angels of God, before the Father in his glory. O what a reward for bearing the testimony of salvation through the blood of Jesus among men, risking oneself in word or life, to be glorified with him, to live and reign with him in his kingdom, as he himself rose from the dead, lives, and reigns unto eternity!

This then is his warning and promise to the disciples; it is a warning and promise to all disciples: Fear the devil and the leaven of the Pharisees!—fear not men, but confess my name before them!

Friend, have you had courage to confess Jesus before men? Has it burned in your heart when you have heard his name reviled, as when your dearest or you yourself were mocked or mistreated? Have you wished to be accursed for Christ, if thereby sinners might be drawn to Jesus and saved through his blood? Or do you pass so quietly and unnoticed through the world that the world itself loves you and praises you, so that you could not bear in your heart to offend it by testifying to it of sin and righteousness and judgment, or by going to the sinner fallen among robbers, bearing him away and bringing him to lodging with Jesus, the crucified?

O friend, fear not men, but confess Jesus and fear the devil!

For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

Fear therefore him who can destroy both body and soul in Hell! Fear not men, but confess Jesus before the world!
