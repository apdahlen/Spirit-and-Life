STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Bærelser" — archaic form of "Værelser" (rooms, dwelling places); must retain spatial concreteness and Johannine resonance (John 14:2), not reduce to abstract "abodes" without weight.
* "forfærdes" — more than "be troubled"; includes terror, inward shaking.
* "berede" — to prepare in solemn, salvific sense; must retain theological depth.
* "tage eder til mig" — intimate, covenantal reception; not merely "receive you."
* "Forkrænkelighedens Trældom" — corruption/decay’s bondage; Pauline resonance (Rom 8:21).
* "underlige Kald" — wondrous/strange calling; must preserve divine initiative.
* "fuldtry Ven" (likely "fuldtrygge" or textual variant) — contextually "faithful/true friend"; must preserve intimacy.
* "Forsoneren" — the Reconciler; active atonement term.
* "Venneskaren" — the company of friends; ecclesial warmth.
* "Svine-maden" — swine’s food; prodigal son imagery.
* "forvildede" — strayed, led astray; pastoral imagery.
* "Faarestien" — sheepfold; Johannine shepherd imagery.
* "maatte" in prayer-wish — strong optative force; not weak possibility.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long accumulative sentences with semicolon logic; must not be broken into short modern fragments.
* Direct biblical citation embedded without typographical distinction; must preserve flow.
* Rhetorical address shifting between exposition and direct appeal.
* Parallelism in consolation formulas.
* Repetitive anaphora: "Jesus har beredt Hjemmet, Jesus har aabnet Hjemmet, Jesus kommer selv..."

Theological Hazards:

* Union of Father and Son (Johannine indwelling language).
* Atonement imagery: blood, reconciliation, wrath removed.
* Justification and cleansing ("Syndernes Forladelse," "renser fra al Synd").
* Adoption and return to the Father.
* Perseverance and safe arrival.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortation to conscience ("Ven," "O hvorfor").
* Intense alternation between despair and consolation.
* Pastoral immediacy.
* Hymnic conclusion retaining prayerful earnestness.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "I min Faders Hus er der mange Bærelser" — John 14:2; KJV "many mansions." Modern equivalent "many dwelling places"; must preserve spatial reality and promise.
* "Jeg vil staa op og gaa til min Fader" — Luke 15:18; prodigal son; repentance as return.
* "Svine-maden" — Luke 15:16; spiritual starvation in estrangement.
* "Davids Nøgle" — Rev 3:7; messianic authority to open and shut.
* "Jesu Kristi, Guds Søns, Blod renser fra al Synd" — 1 John 1:7; cleansing efficacy.
* "fra Fodsaale til Isse" — Isa 1:6; total corruption.
* Shepherd imagery (bearing lambs) — Isa 40:11; Luke 15:5; John 10.
* "vel hjem" — safe home; eschatological arrival.

Literal translation hazards:

* "forfærdes" as merely "be troubled" would weaken intensity.
* "berede" as "arrange" would trivialize salvific preparation.
* "Forsoneren" must remain active agent of reconciliation.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Context: Farewell discourse; impending cross.
* Description of disciples’ love and grief.
* First consolation: many dwelling places.
* Exhortation to the lonely believer.
* Second consolation: Christ prepares the place.
* Atonement scene: doors opened, wrath removed.
* Appeal to sinner wandering in desert.
* Diagnosis: sin causing fear.
* Third consolation: Christ returns to take them; cleansing blood.
* Shepherd assurance of safe arrival.
* Concluding blessedness of life and death in Christ.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 14:1–12 (primary text).
* Romans 8:21 (bondage of corruption).
* Luke 15 (prodigal son).
* Revelation 3:7 (key of David).
* 1 John 1:7 (cleansing blood).
* Isaiah 1:6 (from sole to crown).
* Isaiah 40:11; Luke 15:5; John 10 (shepherd bearing lamb).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain direct address: "Friend," "O why."
* Preserve sharp diagnosis of sin.
* Maintain alternation of despair and consolation.
* Avoid sentimental smoothing.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" — shall (firm promise).
* "maa" — must/shall in prayer-wish context.
* "kan ikke" — cannot (absolute inability).
* "vil" — will (strong volition).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Faders Hus — Father’s house.
* Bærelser — dwelling places.
* Synd — sin.
* Syndernes Forladelse — forgiveness of sins.
* Forsoneren — the Reconciler.
* Hjem — home.
* Salighed — blessedness.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* House/home imagery retained.
* Desert imagery retained.
* Blood-drop imagery preserved concretely.
* Shepherd and lamb imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Grief → Consolation.
* Exile → Home.
* Despair → Cleansing → Boldness.
* Earthly farewell → Heavenly gathering.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with semicolons where argument accumulates.
* Maintain rhythmic repetition.
* Keep proclamatory flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Many Dwelling Places.

Third Sunday after Easter.

John 14:1–12.

"Let not your heart be terrified; believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you, and when I have gone and prepared a place for you, I come again and will take you to myself, that where I am, you also shall be. And where I go, you know, and the way you know." Thomas says to him: "Lord, we do not know where you go; how then can we know the way?" Jesus says to him: "I am the way and the truth and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would also have known my Father; from now on you know him and have seen him." Philip says to him: "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us." Jesus says to him: "So long a time have I been with you, and you have not known me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how then do you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak from myself; but the Father who abides in me, he does the works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if not, then believe for the sake of the works themselves. Truly, truly I say to you: he who believes in me shall also do the works that I do, and greater than these shall he do, because I go to my Father."

Our text belongs to Jesus’ farewell discourses to the disciples; he prepares them for his departure through the death of the cross to the Father.

His departure came upon the disciples as so dreadful a blow that it is impossible for us to comprehend the sorrow and pain it caused them. Of all that on our earth bears the name of love, there has never been anything truer and more inward than the disciples’ love for Jesus. Drawn by him, they had let go of all else; him they had followed; by his word and works they had been lifted up into an entirely new life, of which they had never before had any foreboding; called by him, they had become partakers in a work and a ministry that filled them with the most blessed joy, with the most glorious expectations. They were sent out by him, and they returned to him; in his look they saw approval or rejection of their works, words, and thoughts; by his word their hearts were filled with joy and their souls with new life.

And because there has never been a more blessed life of love upon earth than this, therefore there has also never been a heavier and more solemn separation than that which now stood before them. The beloved Master, the faithful Friend, was to suffer the death of a criminal upon the cross; the little band of disciples was to stand behind utterly forsaken and alone in the world.

Then consolation was needed; strong and blessed consolation, such as the Lord alone could give. And richly and abundantly he gives the consolation in these farewell discourses which we read in the Gospel of John in chapters 14–17.

The first great consolation which Jesus gives the disciples, and which he gives us, is this:

"In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places."

The mighty Savior, the heavenly Friend, points upward to the eternal dwellings for that band of disciples who here in the world have left all things for his sake, and who no longer have any abiding place here upon earth. He himself by his wondrous call has torn them loose from the earthly home and broken the bonds that bound them. Now in the hour of separation it concerns him to keep the eye of their heart unwaveringly fixed upon the home above, that they may not sink back into the bondage of corruption: "In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places."

Praised and blessed be the Lord for this mighty word of consolation. You lonely, forsaken soul, who have become a stranger in the world because you followed the calling voice of Jesus and have lost all in the world for his sake — there is room for you in the home above, room enough; room for all who love the Lord Jesus.

Let me then let go all in the world and love him who loved me; if I have no longer any home here, there above is the Father’s house with many dwelling places.

"I go to prepare a place for you."

This is the second great ground of consolation for the Christian soul. He who is Son in the house has himself gone home to prepare a place for his friends. The Son comes home, blood-sprinkled from the battle with sin and with the power of death and of hell. Then the doors are opened, then lock and bar spring up, then the reconciled Father embraces the Reconciler, the Son of Man, our Brother and our Friend. The wrath is gone, for sin is atoned, and our flesh and blood is set at the Father’s right hand.

He who has the key of David, and who opens and no one shuts, he himself sets the door open to the Father’s house for the company of friends upon earth, for every poor and needy sinner who in faith flees to him.

Friend, a place is prepared for you in the Father’s house. The door stands open; will you not go in? O why do you tumble homeless about in the desert of the world, where yet the thorns pierce and the heart suffers? Look upward to the blessed home that is opened for you. Why do you sit solitary in a foreign land with tear-wet eye and stare toward the earth, while the soul hungers and thirsts and cannot be satisfied with the swine’s food? O come to yourself and say in your heart: "I will arise and go to my Father."

See, the home beckons; see, the Father is ready to receive you. O come, come and find your place prepared for you.

Why does your gaze sink so dark and heavy toward the earth? Why will you not lift it freely and boldly toward the light? O I know what you lack: sin, sin, sin. You dare not, you still shrink back; you know that you are unclean from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head; then you draw your rags together about you and sink down in bitter despair and shame: "I cannot, I dare not show myself there in the blessed home of light, a wretched sinner as I am." Then it is yet more dreadful than before; heaven is open, blessedness beckons and allures; but I do not belong there; for me it is impossible to take a place in the kingdom of light; for me the darkness is a hiding place for my misery.

Yet there is still a word of consolation:

"I come again and will take you to myself, that where I am, you also shall be."

Jesus will not leave any sinful and sorrowing soul behind in despair. He who has prepared heaven for us will also prepare us for heaven. He has made our cause clear before the Father; he has opened all heavens for us; then he comes again to the soul and speaks kindly to it of the reconciled Father’s love. Now he will help you home, you poor, wandering child. You are so unclean and sinful, you dare not come along. But see, he bends down over your grief-worn head, and from his blood-sprinkled brow there flows a drop of the sacrificial blood that was shed for you; it is the forgiveness of sins, it is cleansing from all your uncleanness. "The blood of Jesus Christ, God’s Son, cleanses from all sin." It goes like fire through your bones, and for the first time you dare to lift your eye boldly toward heaven. Blessed sight; it is the Father who stretches out his arms toward you; it is the Son who stands at your side, ready to lead you home to blessed meeting with the Father: "I will take you to myself."

You feel so weary; you cannot walk to the home. Jesus has strong arms; he himself has said that he will carry the strayed lambs back to the sheepfold; fear not, he does not grow weary, he does not fail; if he has found you, he shall lay you upon his shoulders with joy, and you poor lamb shall come safely home. Safely home — yes, that is precisely the matter; safely home, for Jesus has prepared the home, Jesus has opened the home, Jesus himself comes and brings you home.

Blessed is the life of Christians when Jesus goes at their side and leads them so safely on the way; yet more blessed is their death, when they go with him from a foreign land to the Father’s house:

Then the door is opened to heaven’s city,
There the names of the redeemed are named.
God grant that we all may meet in gladness,
And none of ours be missing!
May God grant it us for Christ’s blood,
That we may in heaven find harbor.
