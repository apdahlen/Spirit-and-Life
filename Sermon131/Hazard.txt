STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Hyklerne” — not merely “hypocrites” in a casual sense, but religious pretenders engaged in performative piety.
* “Løndom” — secrecy, hiddenness before God; carries spiritual interiority, not mere privacy.
* “Betale dig aabenbare” — “reward you openly,” but with theological nuance of divine recompense.
* “Hjertets skjulte Menneske” — the “hidden man of the heart” (1 Pet. 3:4 resonance).

* “Beder uden Afladelse” — “pray without ceasing” (1 Thess. 5:17).
* “Trængsler og Møie” — tribulations and toil; existential burden of earthly life.

* “Herrens Kjødets Dage” — days of the Lord’s flesh.
* “hoffærdige Vantro” — proud unbelief.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long accumulative sentences with semicolon pivots.
* Sermonic parallelisms and rhetorical build-up.
* Conditional clauses carrying doctrinal weight.
* Frequent shifts between exposition and exhortation.
* Embedded biblical quotations requiring structural preservation.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between hypocritical and true prayer.
* Hidden life before God.
* Grace enabling filial address (“Abba, Father”).
* Flesh versus new man born of God.
* Divine will versus human will.
* Forgiveness tied to forgiving others.
* Temptation and deliverance from evil.
* Fatherhood of God as covenantal and Christ-mediated.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Direct address to conscience (“Har du ingen Nød…”).
* Emotional intensity in appeals to surrender.
* Confessional humility paired with doctrinal certainty.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Hjertets skjulte Menneske” — echoes 1 Peter 3:4; refers to inward spiritual being.
* “Beder uden Afladelse” — 1 Thessalonians 5:17; habitual prayerful orientation.
* “raaber af det dybe” — Psalm 130; existential cry of repentance.
* “Abba, Fader” — Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6; Spirit-enabled filial cry.
* “Naadens Trone” — Hebrews 4:16; access through Christ.
* “Ske ikke min, men din Vilje” — Luke 22:42; Gethsemane.
* “over al Maade vægtig Herlighed” — 2 Corinthians 4:17.
* “umyndiges og diendes Mund” — Psalm 8:2; Matthew 21:16.

Literal translation of these without biblical resonance would weaken doctrinal force. Established English biblical equivalents should be used where structurally fitting.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening citation of the Lord’s Prayer text.
* Warning against hypocritical prayer.
* Description of true hidden prayer and its fruit.
* Warning against pagan verbosity.
* Teaching of the Lord’s Prayer.
* Extended meditation on “Father.”
* Surrender to God’s will.
* Confidence in petitions for daily bread, forgiveness, protection.
* Consolation in divine fatherly wisdom.
* Testimony of saints.
* Concluding praise and eschatological hope.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 6:5–13 (primary text).
* 1 Thessalonians 5:17.

* Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6.
* Hebrews 4:16.
* Luke 22:42.
* 2 Corinthians 4:17.
* Psalm 8:2.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings remain sharp.
Appeals to conscience remain direct.
Consolation flows from doctrine, not sentiment.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skal” rendered as “shall.”
* “maa” rendered as “must” or “may” depending on context.
* Imperatives preserved with full force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Will
* Glory
* Temptation
* Evil
* Throne of grace
* Boldness

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fragile vessel retained.
* Weight of glory retained.

* Semicolon logic maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

Our Father.

Fifth Sunday after Easter.

Matthew 6:5–13.

When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men; truly I say to you, they have received their reward. But you, when you pray, go into your chamber, and shut your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you openly. And when you pray, do not use many superfluous words as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their many words. Therefore you shall not be like them; for your Father knows what you have need of before you ask him. Therefore you shall pray thus: Our Father, who are in heaven! Hallowed be your Name! Your kingdom come! Your will be done, as in heaven, so also upon earth! Give us this day our daily bread! And forgive us our debt, as we also forgive our debtors! And lead us not into temptation! But deliver us from evil! For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever. Amen.

Jesus warns against the prayer of the hypocrite, which is held in the synagogues and at the street corners for the sake of men. The heavenly Father does not hear such prayer. If prayer does not proceed from your heart, then it does not reach the Father’s heart. Prayer belongs to the hidden man of the heart and to a quiet spirit’s incorruptible being, which is very precious before God. Where such prayer is found, so that a human heart daily, early, and continually is turned toward God, there the Apostle’s exhortation is fulfilled: “Pray without ceasing.” There also in a person’s life is a hidden power which bears up under the tribulations and toil of earthly life and gives that heart-peace which is the open recompense that accompanies the hidden life in God.

The Savior also warns against the heathen’s superfluous words in prayer. The many words dishonor the Father; for he knows his children’s needs before they ask him. It is not he who needs to hear our long explanations of all that we lack; it is we who need the Father’s help. And as with the disciples: “Lord, save us, we perish!” so is the prayer of those who truly cry out of the depths to the Lord. In the hour of distress the cry of need is short and piercing; and he who is not in distress does not pray. Distress is the mother of prayer; therefore prayer is so brief in words and so certain to press forward to the Father’s merciful ear and compassionate heart. If you have no distress and no need, this is the greatest misery; cry to the Lord even over this, that he may show you your wretchedness, and you shall be heard.

But his disciples Jesus teaches to pray, “Our Father.” And with good reason both long and short explanations have been written over this prayer; and yet its content is not exhausted and its glory not dimmed. Still it is for all needy children of God equally beautiful and equally rich, equally weighty and humbling, equally blessed and uplifting. Gladly would we also, though with stammering tongue, speak a few words concerning Our Father.

And chiefly this is to be said: he who can rightly pass over the first words, “Our Father, who are in heaven,” he has come far in the art of praying aright. For for a poor sinner, who has every reason with the publican to strike his breast and turn his eyes toward the earth, it is an unspeakable mystery of grace to dare to turn to the Lord, who sits enthroned on high and is the Holy One, and say: “Abba, Father.” Had he not himself taught us this, the blessed Son of God, through whom we have access to the Father; had not the Spirit of the Lord himself taught us this in our hearts’ brokenness and shame, we would never have found our way to it. It is the Son and the Spirit alone who place the Abba-cry into the sinner’s heart and give boldness to draw near to the throne of grace. O that my heart might rightly cling fast to this blessed, lovely Name, so that with full confidence I might lay my cause into God’s hand; then all else would be light and bright; for if he who governs all is my Father, what else can meet me but love and mercy upon all my ways? All prayer will be easy to pray when it is my Father of whom I ask something. Were there more real, sincere, and simple faith in the Father, then the life of God’s children would be less sighing and complaining, more full of heavenly peace and joy. Then also all the following petitions in the Lord’s Prayer would become more truth in our heart and in our mouth.

For if we have first rightly grasped the Father-name in prayer and faith, then it falls easily for the Spirit, though heavily for the flesh, to pray: “Hallowed be your Name, your kingdom come, your will be done!” For even though our flesh rises up in us and desires its own glory, its own power, and its own will—yet for the man of God in us, who is born of God, the only blessedness, peace, and rest lie herein: that God is glorified, that his kingdom comes, and his will is done. Bow yourself, heart, and learn to pray: Not my will, but yours be done! Though it must happen with tears and in fear and anguish as for the Savior in Gethsemane—if it is your heavenly Father’s will under which you bow, it is nevertheless your best, it is nevertheless your good. But therefore so many prayers are not fulfilled, because we pray: Our will be done! O no, Father, not my desire, but yours; not my foolish, unwise, sinful will, but your good and wise and perfect will—let that be done, let that be done now and always in me and with me; then I know that it goes well with me; for you, Father, do not give your child anything evil.

But if you have truly wrestled thus far in prayer, and have received grace to believe this fully and wholly, then you shall also receive boldness to pray the four last petitions: “Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debt, as we also forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil!”

For truly, you have nothing but need and guilt and distress to lay before God in these petitions; yet if it is to a gracious Father you come, if it is with full faith in his grace, if it is with full surrender to his will, then it is nevertheless safe to come, though you come empty-handed, indebted, tempted, and suffering. See, it is the Father’s delight and joy to give you all that you need. As it is your childlike joy that your Father be exalted and glorified, so it is his fatherly joy to be able to shower you with good gifts, according as you need and can bear. Remember well that you are a very fragile vessel so long as you still walk in your earthly condition; and thank the Lord in humility that he does not give you according to your folly, but according to his wisdom. In his time he who must now cautiously lay heavenly gifts into your soul shall bestow upon you an eternal and beyond all measure weighty glory, when all danger is over, when all temptation is past.

Then you may confidently set Amen to this prayer. If you prayed it in faith as child to Father, it is fulfilled and it shall be fulfilled. Ask all God’s children, and they will tell you so. With shame and blush they will confess that it often happened to them that they did not come through their Our Father, because it became too great for them and their heart became too full; but so long as they received grace to pray, so long they also found answer to prayer, and from day to day there came response from the heavenly Father to their stammering prayer.

Thus be the Lord praised for “Our Father” and for all the peace and blessedness which this prayer has given our hearts. Thanks be to the Holy Spirit, who loosed our bound tongue and taught us to cry: Abba, Father!

And as this prayer has gone with light and strength down through the centuries from the days of the Lord’s flesh until now, so shall it also remain all believers’ comfort and joy until the Lord comes again. And though the proud unbelief of the world may be able to bring many tongues to silence, the Lord shall nevertheless through the Lord’s Prayer prepare for himself a power upon earth out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, whom a pious mother taught the Lord’s own prayer.
