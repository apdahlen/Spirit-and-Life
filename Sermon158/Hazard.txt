STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Optages" — refers to Christ’s being taken up (Ascension), not merely departure.
* "Menneskens Søn" — biblical title "Son of Man," must retain scriptural resonance.
* "Fordærve Menneskers Sjæle" — not merely "harm" but "destroy" in an eternal sense.
* "Frelse" — salvation in full theological sense.
* "Kjødelige" — fleshly, carnal; Pauline theological category.
* "Bekjendelse / Bekjender" — confession in faith sense, not mere admission.
* "Forsagelsen" — renunciation, self-denial (ascetical and evangelical nuance).
* "Forargelse" — offense in biblical stumbling-stone sense.
* "Vel skikket" — fit, suitable, properly disposed for the Kingdom.
* "Et er fornødent" — "one thing is necessary," strong exclusivity.
* "Ransag" — examine/search (biblical, conscience-directed).
* "Klendodie" — prize, treasure (Phil. 3:14 resonance).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with accumulating clauses.
* Frequent semicolon logic preserving theological build-up.
* Embedded Scripture quotations integrated into argument.
* Rhetorical questions directed to conscience.
* Narrative exposition shifting into exhortation without structural break.

Theological Hazards:

* Christ’s journey to Jerusalem interpreted as passion-journey.
* Nature of discipleship as participation in suffering.
* Contrast between fleshly enthusiasm and true cross-bearing.
* Renunciation of natural affections for Kingdom priority.
* Perseverance vs. apostasy ("the last worse than the first").
* Eternal hope vs. self-deception.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran sermonic tone.
* Direct address to reader’s conscience ("But, have you considered this?").
* Sharp warnings without sentimental mitigation.
* Pastoral gravity combined with doctrinal clarity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Vendte sit Ansigt til at vandre til Jerusalem" — Hebraic idiom indicating resolute determination (cf. Isa. 50:7). Should retain physical imagery of face set toward Jerusalem.
* "Det sidste er værre end det første" — Matthew 12:45 echo; warning against relapse.
* "Bære sit Kors" — discipleship as participation in suffering (Luke 14:27).
* "Lad de døde begrave sine døde" — spiritual dead vs. physically dead; paradox must remain sharp.
* "Lægger sin Haand paa Plogen" — agricultural metaphor of undivided commitment.
* "Ægyptens Kjødgryder" — Exodus 16; nostalgia for bondage.
* "Under Skyen" / "aandelige Mad og Drik" — 1 Corinthians 10; sacramental typology.
* "Klendodie" — Philippians 3:14; prize of upward calling.

Literal renderings must preserve metaphor rather than interpret it away.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Narrative setting: Jesus’ final journey to Jerusalem.
* Disciples’ misunderstanding: ambition, pride, zeal without spirit.
* Christ’s corrective word: mission to save, not destroy.
* First example: impulsive enthusiast; cost of discipleship.
* Warning against fleshly excitement.
* Second example: legitimate duty (burial) subordinated to Kingdom.
* Radical priority of God’s Kingdom.
* Third example: divided affection; backward glance.
* Biblical exempla: Exodus generation, Lot’s wife.
* Concluding exhortation: forward striving toward heavenly prize.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 9:51–62 (primary text).
* Luke 14:26–28.
* Matthew 12:45.
* Exodus 14–16.
* 1 Corinthians 10:1–5.
* Philippians 3:13–14.
* Genesis 19 (Lot’s wife).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings against apostasy, divided heart, and self-deception must remain unsoftened. Direct address retained. Severity preserved.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "Maa" rendered as "must" not "should."
* "Kan ikke" rendered as "cannot," absolute exclusion.
* "Er fornødent" rendered as "is necessary," not "is helpful."

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Frelse — salvation.
* Rige — Kingdom.
* Bekjendelse — confession.
* Forsagelse — renunciation.
* Discipel — disciple.
* Aand — Spirit (capitalized when divine implication clear).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Agricultural, exodus, burial, plow, cross, prize metaphors retained intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Severity (warnings) contrasted with hope (prize, salvation).

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long cumulative sentences preserved; semicolon pivots maintained; exhortational rhythm retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

On the Imitation of Christ.

Second Sunday after Trinity.

Luke 9:51–62.

What is here related took place while Jesus with his disciples was on his last journey to Jerusalem. For in the fifty-first verse it stands written that "when the days were fulfilled that he should be taken up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem." His disciples also understood that this was a decisive going, which, according to their thought, would at last bring the expected glory. Therefore they were moved in a peculiar degree by lofty, indeed almost proud and victory-assured thoughts. They already had time to consider "which of them should be greatest"; they were strangely angered at one who cast out devils in Jesus’ name and "followed not with them"; and John and James were so inflamed at the boldness of the Samaritans in refusing Jesus lodging that they asked permission to command fire to fall from heaven and consume them.

How must not each of these words have been as a barb in Jesus’ heart, bowing his head yet deeper toward the earth! He answered them lovingly and meekly: "The Son of Man is not come to destroy men’s souls, but to save,"—and continued the way with Gethsemane and Golgotha before his soul’s eye.

Ah, poor disciples! they were yet far from understanding what a way of suffering this journey was for Jesus, still less that their own reward of glory should consist in following after him upon the way of the Cross and of renunciation. Their thoughts were yet fleshly.

Under these circumstances, and under the influence of that tension and enthusiasm with which hearts were filled, one comes to him and says: "Lord, I will follow you wherever you go."

In truth a fair and right confession, and surely sincere! And yet, how deceptive! Not so much for others as for oneself!

Jesus’ answer shows it:

"The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests; but the Son of Man has not where he may lay his head."

It is a grave answer, well fitted to cast down all fleshly imaginations and expectations with respect to the imitation of Jesus, and to bring one to reflection what it truly means to "follow Jesus," and that there is a condition of which Jesus himself says that "the last is worse than the first."

In the many centuries which have run their course since Jesus laid this weighty admonition upon a hasty confessor’s, a newly awakened disciple’s heart, human nature has not changed a hair’s breadth. While it may swiftly be brought to rejoice and be exalted by faith that Christ by his suffering and death upon the Cross has paid for all sin, it recoils and withdraws when the Lord reminds: What I have given up, you also must give up; what I have suffered, you also must suffer.

Thus it comes to pass that even in our days there are multitudes of awakened Christians who after a shorter or longer time fall away—lovely, ready, sincere confessors, for whom the Cross and renunciation have come so unexpectedly upon their heaven-longings and hallelujah-cries that they have become to them an offense, and the last has become worse than the first. They did not heed this weighty word of Jesus: "Whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple." The Son of Man has not where he may lay his head.

But have you considered this?

In contrast to the hasty and fervent yet unreflecting confession which does not reckon "what it will cost to finish a tower," and therefore runs the danger of soon falling away, there is presented in the two following examples a class of Christ’s followers who are also ready and willing, but who are still governed by considerations which in themselves are wholly justified, yet which become a snare, a stumbling-block, and a rock of offense when they are placed alongside of, or even before, the following of Christ.

The Lord says to one: "Follow me." He is ready, but he will be allowed "first to go and bury his father."

It is not wrong to bury one’s deceased father; on the contrary, among heathen and Jews and Christians, among all peoples who yet retain the poorest remnant of religion, it has been regarded as one of the holiest duties to give one’s nearest and dearest a seemly burial. The greatest disgrace—more dreaded by the noblest men than death itself—was to remain unburied, a prey to dogs and wild beasts. The history of Ahab and of Tobit shows fully how highly a seemly burial was esteemed among the Jews.

Nothing is more dangerous or more difficult to break with than customs handed down from the fathers. Nothing angered the most zealous Jews more than that Jesus healed on the Sabbath; and within almost every Church there are customs, mere and simple customs, which have awakened more bitter strife than the most important truths.

But fearlessly Jesus breaks every regard to custom when it comes side by side with, or even in the way of, following him. "One thing is necessary; and first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness"—this is his doctrine.

"Let the dead bury their dead," he said. You need have no fear more for your dead father; there will be enough of those who see that he comes seemly to the earth. The more one is dead in himself and without hope for eternity, the more he seeks to deceive others and himself by attempting to mend death with a fair burial. You also must be prepared to bear the shame of neglecting so holy a custom as to bury your own father; for you it is necessary to cast aside all else in order to do these two alone necessary things: "to follow me" and "to proclaim the Kingdom of God."

It was a hard saying; nor does it stand written that the disciple could hear it. But as Jesus says to one, "Give all that you have to the poor," to another, "Let your father lie unburied," so there is for you, whoever you are, one thing which you either reluctantly or not at all will give up, which by every conceivable means you seek to place beside or in harmony with your Christianity, one thing to which your heart clings more than you will confess or know, so that this thing in reality becomes first, Jesus second—But the Lord requires of you this one thing—search your heart, be honest toward yourself, that you be not deceived of the hope of eternity.

"Let the dead bury their dead!"

There is no bond so holy, no love so strong, no object so precious, that you must not be ready to relinquish it in order wholly and undividedly to follow Jesus. This is what Jesus declares in the third example, where another disciple expressed his willingness to follow Jesus if only he might first take leave of those in his house. It is not mentioned whether they were parents, wife, or children; it is the same. Jesus’ answer is as a two-edged sword to reveal the secret counsels of hearts. It shows in this case that the disciple, perhaps himself unaware, had his first, his strongest love in his home; that he at once beforehand must become clear about this, receive grace to relinquish it according to that word from Jesus’ mouth: "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple," and thereafter reckon these earth’s most precious things among those which "shall be added," and for which a follower of Christ shall be without anxiety; else he would come into the same danger as Lot’s wife, look back to the glory of Sodom and become a pillar of salt.

"No one who lays his hand upon the plow and looks back to what is behind him is fit for the Kingdom of God."

After incomprehensible sufferings and mighty manifestations of God’s power, the Jews gained courage to tear themselves loose from Egypt’s bondage and went forth bravely until they came to the Red Sea. There they stood: the sea before and Pharaoh’s host behind. It might well bring the bravest to despondency. "Go forward," said the Lord; and they went straight into the sea and sang the Lord’s praise on the other side, while Pharaoh’s host lay buried in the deep. But soon it was all forgotten, and hearts stole back to Egypt’s flesh-pots and rebelled and hardened themselves against the Lord. "They were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; they all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; but with most of them God was not well pleased; they were overthrown in the wilderness."

They had laid hand upon the plow, but looked back.

But remember Lot’s wife, remember the serpent-bitten children of Israel, remember your own deceitful heart, and follow Paul’s counsel:

"Forgetting what is behind and reaching forth unto what is before, I press toward the goal unto the prize which belongs to the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
