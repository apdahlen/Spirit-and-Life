STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Retfærdighed” — must distinguish between moral righteousness, legal righteousness, and specifically the Pauline-Lutheran forensic righteousness of faith.
* “Ufærdi g” (ufærdig) — not merely “unfinished,” but morally unready, rash.
* “Dadlesyge” — censoriousness, fault-finding spirit.
* “Letsindighed” — not mere lightness, but irreverent spiritual frivolity.
* “Egenretfærdighed” — self-righteousness in a doctrinal sense (justifying oneself before God).
* “Syndserkjendelse” — experiential recognition/conviction of sin.
* “Omvendelse” — repentance in the full theological sense (conversion).
* “Fylde” — fullness in a theological sense (plērōma conceptually).
* “Indesluttet alt under Synd” — Pauline forensic enclosure under sin.
* “Tveæggede Sværd” — biblical metaphor (Heb. 4:12 resonance).
* “Fristaden” — refuge city (Old Testament typology applied to Golgotha).
* “Helligdom” — sacred things / sanctuary, possibly Word and Sacraments.
* “Skalkeskjul” — hypocritical cover, pretext.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long accumulative sentences with semicolon pivots.
* Embedded Scripture quotations within argument.
* Rhetorical questions building toward existential confrontation.
* Sermonic repetition (“Broder og Søster, hvor staar du?”).
* Logical escalation from moral observation to doctrinal thesis.

Theological Hazards:

* Contrast between Law and Gospel.
* Fulfillment of the Law in Christ versus moral idealism.
* Distinction between Pharisaic righteousness and righteousness of faith.
* Conviction of sin as purpose of the Law.
* Justification by faith in Christ.
* Sanctification as fruit of Christ’s love poured out by the Holy Spirit.
* Sacramental reverence (Baptism, Lord’s Supper).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Direct address to conscience.
* Moral severity followed by evangelical invitation.
* Irony toward Rationalism and moralism.
* Climactic questioning designed to implicate the hearer.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Fei først for din egen Dør” — proverb: “Sweep first before your own door.” Equivalent to removing the beam before the mote (Matt. 7:3–5).
* “Du skal ikke rø’e i andre Folks Mø’e” — rustic proverb: do not stir in another’s manure; equivalent to meddling in others’ faults.
* “Paa Mose Stol sidder de Skriftkloge” — Matt. 23:2–3; Mosaic authority acknowledged.
* “Synden ved Budet skulde blive overmaade syndig” — Romans 7:13.
* “Skriften indesluttet alt under Synd” — Galatians 3:22.
* “Blind leder blind” — Luke 6:39.
* “Tveæggede Sværd” — Hebrews 4:12.
* “Fristaden” — Cities of Refuge (Numbers 35), typologically fulfilled in Christ.
* “Hængte ham paa Træet” — Acts 5:30; 1 Peter 2:24.

Literal rendering of rustic sayings would obscure force; English equivalents should preserve proverbial clarity without flattening biblical resonance.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Introduction: Three warnings in the text (judging, fault-finding, profaning holy things).
2. Contemporary application: Censoriousness and irreverence in congregations.
3. Critique of superficial moral preaching.
4. Rejection of Rationalist reading of Sermon on the Mount.
5. Contrast with Pharisaic legalism.
6. Thesis: Christ came to proclaim a new righteousness.
7. Law fulfilled in Christ; Law reveals sin, cannot save.
8. Necessity of righteousness of faith.
9. Blind leading blind — Pharisaic misuse of Law.
10. Warning against profaning holy things.
11. Direct existential appeal: Where do you stand?
12. Final evangelical invitation and climactic longing.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 7:1–6 (primary text).
* Matthew 23:2–3.
* Romans 7:13.
* Galatians 3:21–22.
* Luke 6:36–42.
* Hebrews 4:12.
* Acts 5:30 / 1 Peter 2:24.
* Romans 5:5 (love poured out by the Holy Spirit).
* Exodus / Numbers (Cities of Refuge typology).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retfærdighed — righteousness.
* Egenretfærdighed — self-righteousness.
* Omvendelse — repentance.
* Tro — faith.
* Naade — grace.
* Synd — sin.
* Lov — Law.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Beam and mote imagery intact.
* Law as mirror.
* Two-edged sword.
* Trampling under foot.
* Refuge at Golgotha.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

A New Righteousness.

Fourth Sunday after Trinity.

Matthew 7:1–6. Judge not, that you be not judged; for with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged, and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you again. And why do you see the mote that is in your brother’s eye, but do not become aware of the beam that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, Hold! I will draw the mote out of your eye; and behold, there is a beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First draw the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to draw the mote out of your brother’s eye. Give not what is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you.

There are three things which the Savior through these words admonishes the disciples and all Christians against: to be rash and unready in judgment over others; to blame the faults of others before one has seen and corrected one’s own; and to deal lightly with what is holy.

Useful and necessary admonitions are they all; and with good reason every preacher will employ this text earnestly to rebuke that censoriousness, fault-finding spirit, and irreverence in the handling of holy things which, not only among members of the congregation in general but also among converted children of God, often appear in grievous measure.

Mutual suspicion and distrust are not unknown in the congregations; and when those who are called by Christ’s name and baptized with his Baptism speak of one another, judge one another, explain the motives of one another’s actions, there is at times a heartlessness, a spirit of self-satisfaction, yes, of bitterness therein, which must cause any to shudder who remembers the Master’s command to love one another and the doctrine of Christianity that its confessors belong to the same Father’s house.

The children of God therefore often divide themselves into small circles and cliques, which mutually sigh over one another, shake their heads over one another, and are continually anxious and troubled with doubt whether “the others” are in truth children of God; one may well know how it fares with love under such circumstances.

Many members of the congregation go to the holy Supper twice a year just as regularly as they attend to spring sowing and autumn harvest, and not with a tenth part so much seriousness. They send for God’s servants an hour before a near relative dies and are yet fearful that they have “troubled” the pastor too early; and while in many places they stand outside the church door after the service has begun and chatter and trifle and trade, and when they finally come in give a sigh of relief when the sermon is over, yet they fear that the Baptism over their children has not had the proper power if the pastor has forgotten to make the sign of the cross over them.

Such and many other half-heathen and half-Catholic survivals of superstition often come to light, coupled with indifference toward that which in truth can save a man: the Word of God and faith; so that a servant of God many a time knows neither where to begin nor where to end, so much rashness, self-righteousness, and Christian untruth and superstition meet him when he considers this text.

And yet not even the strictest moral sermon, held without respect of persons, can be all that Jesus intended by these remarkable words about judging and measuring and correcting one’s neighbor. We must look deeper. The Savior has assuredly another purpose than merely to admonish against the daily faults and falls to which we are all exposed.

Reason-Christianity would gladly see in the Sermon on the Mount a collection of moral precepts of the highest and purest kind, and therein places Christ’s merit, that he, like Confucius, Buddha, and other founders of religion, was able both in life and teaching to present a purer morality than his age. The Rationalists have therefore always confessed that in Jesus of Nazareth they saw an ideal moral teacher. Already this will make it evident to every Christian that Jesus by the Sermon on the Mount intended something altogether different than to give a compiled textbook even of the highest morality. One does not learn to know Jesus and his teaching by way of reason.

But first of all it was precisely in opposition to the Pharisees and their moral precepts, drawn out into the finest consequences, that the Lord appeared and spoke. It is a misunderstanding when anyone supposes that after an almost two-thousand-year study of the Law of Moses the Pharisees lacked moral commandments of the highest and purest kind as well as of the more ordinary sort. Therein did not their error consist, that they did not have commandments enough, and indeed holy and excellent commandments enough; therefore Jesus says: The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat; all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do (Matt. 23:2–3).

But herein consisted their fundamental error, their spiritual blindness, that they meant and taught that when anyone kept the commandments, as they had earnestly and extensively expounded and interpreted them, such a one thereby became righteous before God.

And as particularly the commandments here mentioned by Jesus, about judging and finding fault with others, are concerned, they are, considered merely morally, neither of higher nor purer sort than that they are incorporated into the common moral consciousness of most peoples in the form of proverbs and the like, such as: Sweep first before your own door; do not stir in other men’s refuse, and so forth.

The Savior intended neither to give, as it were, a brief compendium of the best and noblest found in humanity’s moral consciousness — as the Rationalists assert — nor to supplement the Pharisees’ already overfilled collection of laws with some new commandments.

He had rather come to proclaim a new righteousness.

Therefore he says to his disciples at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount: Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven. And a Gamaliel’s, a Hillel’s, a Paul’s righteousness was, humanly speaking, not to be despised; there are many today who believe that it can even stand before God and only wish that they were so pure and blameless as those named. And immediately before he says: I have not come to abolish the Law and the Prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.

That is the matter. He has come to fulfill the Law, that is, to present it in its full measure, in its true, holy, divine content, an image of God’s own holy being, realized in human form in the person of Jesus Christ. In this form the Law is presented, not that men therein should have a moral ideal of which they may dream, and the best of them leap after by all manner of abstinence, mortification, and extraordinary worship, which indeed has a show of wisdom, but in reality is only satisfaction of the flesh; but Jesus presents the Law as he does in order that it should convince of sin, that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful; that men should understand that if there had been given a law which could give life, then righteousness would indeed have been by the Law, but now Scripture has shut up all under sin; that to save is impossible for the Law, wherefore the merciful God has prepared for us a way of salvation by sending his only-begotten Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin’s sake to suffer and die for us, so that by the Holy Spirit and faith in us the requirement of the Law may be fulfilled in us.

Therefore Jesus set forth the Law as he did in the Sermon on the Mount, in order to bring men to the knowledge of sin, to repentance, and to faith in a new righteousness, the righteousness by faith in Christ.

When we compare our text with the old one for the same Sunday in Luke (6:36–42), we find the same. For there the admonition against judging is introduced with these words: Therefore be merciful, as your heavenly Father also is merciful, and judge not. What man can be merciful as God without one: the man Jesus? And God in heaven can admit into his fellowship none but him who is perfect like him. Thus there is required a greater righteousness than that of the Law, than that of the Pharisees, than that of the highest moral teacher; there is required nothing less than Christ’s righteousness, the righteousness of faith.

The parable of the mote in the brother’s eye is in Luke introduced with this question: Can a blind man lead a blind man? Shall they not both fall into the pit?

This casts light over the whole passage. It is precisely in opposition to the Pharisees’ self-righteousness that Jesus gives the Law the interpretation which necessitates a new righteousness. It is the scribes and Pharisees who are blind; the Law, instead of being to them a mirror of God’s holiness to bring them to the knowledge of sin, has in their eyes become a beam that makes them spiritually stone-blind, so that they know not sin, but only faults, transgressions, and trivialities, indeed of the very finest kind, yet still only human, and especially in “others.”

But in this condition there arises precisely the greatest frivolity toward what is holy and the bitterest intolerance toward those who think differently. Where God’s Law is transformed into — be it thousands of — human commandments, or where God’s doctrine of salvation is transformed into human learning, there the holy has fallen among dogs and pearls have come to swine; and if you dare to say this to them, they will assuredly turn and rend you, as they also did to Jesus when they hanged him on the tree.

Well then, Brother and Sister, where do you stand? Have you used God’s Word and God’s holy things as a cloak for your self-righteousness and trampled the blood of the Son of God under your feet?

Or have you by God’s Spirit allowed the two-edged sword of his Law to pierce your heart to reveal sin and bear witness of righteousness and judgment? Have you thus received grace to draw the beam out of your eye and become seeing, and in the shame of your nakedness, in the distress of your condemnation fled to the refuge, Golgotha, to be washed in Jesus’ precious blood and receive a new righteousness?

Have you thus had Christ’s love poured out in you by the Holy Spirit, so that you no longer judge your brother, but love him and would gladly be an accursed thing from God if you might win a single heart for Jesus?

Oh, how would it not then become among us!
Brother and Sister, where do you stand?
