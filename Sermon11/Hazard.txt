Four Witnesses

Fourth Sunday in Advent

John 5:31–39. “If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true; there is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the witness he bears of me is true. You sent messengers to John, and he bore witness to the truth. Yet I do not receive witness from a human being; but I say this so that you may be saved. He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light. But I have a witness greater than John’s; for the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, these works that I do, bear witness of me that the Father has sent me. And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness of me. You have neither ever heard his voice nor seen his form, and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent. You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness of me.”

The Jews wished to kill Jesus, not because he had healed the sick man at the pool of Bethesda, but, as they said, because he had done it on a Sabbath.

The Lord took occasion from this to show that for him, in his work, there was no Sabbath, because he was the Son of God and worked as the Father works until now; but therefore, instead of wishing to kill him, they were obligated to honor him as the Father, all the more since they ought to remember that the Father has also given all judgment to the Son, in time and in eternity.

These were heavy and perilous words for one to utter who in every respect appeared like any other human being; therefore he places witnesses into the hands of the Jews, so that they might have no excuse.

The first is John the Baptist. Him the Jews had indeed made much of. For a time at least he suited their expectations and aroused great hopes among them through his strict life, his prophetic appearance, and his earnest preaching of repentance. All Jerusalem and Judea had gone out to him. He had borne witness to Jesus and said: “Behold the Lamb of God, who bears the sin of the world.”

Should they not receive his witness gladly? As long as it was new and sensational, they rejoiced in it as in a burning and shining lamp, in the hope that something great for them would come of it. But when they truly began to consider what he preached—repentance and conversion and a suffering Savior—and when they saw that he himself had to lose his life for a king’s whim, they turned their backs on his holy words.

The Lord wishes to remind them of their faithlessness and the instability of the heart, not because he needs John’s witness, but because it might perhaps bring them to reflection.

For he himself has a greater witness: the works that his Father had given him to accomplish, and which had taken place before the eyes of all the people, according to the Lord’s own word that he sent to John in prison: “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame leap, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is preached to the poor.”

What then was the Jews’ answer when the Lord had done these wonders and pointed to them? Give us a sign! They would not repent.

Jesus had another witness: the Father himself, as John had heard it at Jesus’ baptism and proclaimed it, and as the apostles were allowed to hear it on the Mount of Transfiguration: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him!”

Did they listen to him? Alas, no; they answered: You are a Samaritan and have a demon; they would not listen to the Father either.

Therefore Jesus finally brings forward a last witness to them and against them: the Word of God, the Scriptures. “You search the Scriptures,” he says, “you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is precisely these that bear witness of me and say: whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; but whoever does not believe in the Son does not have life, but the wrath of God remains over him.” Did they bow under this witness? Alas, no; they did not have God’s word abiding in them; they did not believe in him whom God has sent.

And now all you who are baptized with Christ’s baptism and called by his name, what are these four witnesses concerning the Son of God for us? Have they bent our hearts or hardened them as the hearts of the Jews?

Perhaps you have been cast upon a sickbed, perhaps struck and paralyzed by some great sorrow, by deserved or undeserved misfortune; a lightning bolt has struck down before you as for Luther, death has opened its jaws toward you; a voice has sounded to you: “You fool, this night your life will be demanded of you! Repent while it is called today!” You were unspeakably terrified in your soul; you awoke from the sleep of sin with dread; you saw your sin, your evil corrupted heart, as you had never seen it before, and the judgment of hell stood painted before you. On the one side it sounded: “The axe is already laid at the root of the tree; every tree that does not bear good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire,” on the other: “Behold the Lamb of God, who bears the sin of the world!”

But where have these voices and cries gone now? Where do you stand? That was John’s witness; have you cast them all behind your back?

Yet strange works have taken place all around you; hard, resistant sinners have been converted to God and born again; they have abandoned the way of sin and vice and have learned a new song, a song of praise; they have received new sight and a new heart; they have begun to proclaim the great works of God and to love their neighbor with Christ’s love; the old has passed away, and everything has become new; the gospel has been preached to the poor.

Has this also passed your heart by, without working anything other than a harder disposition—oh, then remember the judgment of the Jewish people.

Or has the Father himself spoken to you?

Had you come so far that you were allowed to hear and appropriate in childlike faith this word: “Take courage, your sins are forgiven you,” and did you receive witness from God’s Spirit in your spirit that you were a child of God and had the right to cry: Abba, Father?

Oh, where are you now? Have you remained standing in this blessed state of grace with daily access to the throne of grace in the Son, or have you even cast this witness from you, so that the last has become worse for you than the first?

But perhaps you still search the Scriptures; you have preserved the outward Christian life; you go to the Lord’s table and to his house; you listen Sunday after Sunday to the Word of God and read it at home both morning and evening. But it rebounds from your heart, which has become harder year after year. The sharpest arrows of the Law fall blunted against the hard wall of your heart, and the sweetest tones of the Gospel pass unnoticed by your soul. Oh, what a condition, when even the witness of God’s Word loses its power! when it was “Hosanna!” yesterday and is “Crucify!” today! What a Christmas season for the one who not only with coldness and indifference, but even with contempt, looks upon the little child Jesus lying in the manger, the Word who became flesh in order to save us!

But praise be to the Lord! still it is the day of grace, still it is Advent time; once again the Lord stretches out his arms and says: “Come here, that I may save you! do not cast my witnesses behind your back!”

What kind of Christmas shall it be for you?
