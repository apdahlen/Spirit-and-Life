STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Benegtelse / benægte: not mere negation, but principled doctrinal denial.
* Opstandelse: resurrection, with full eschatological weight.
* Kjødlighed / Sandselighed: fleshly-mindedness, sensuality in Pauline sense.
* Aand / Aandelig: Spirit / spiritual, not merely inward or emotional.
* Nødløgn: morally justified lie, debated in Lutheran ethics.
* Myggen og Kamelen: biblical idiom (Matt. 23:24).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Very long sentences with embedded causal logic.
* Sermonic parallelisms and rhetorical escalation.
* Direct speech embedded within argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Resurrection of the dead as doctrinal cornerstone.
* Distinction between this world and the world to come.
* Judgment, accountability, and bodily resurrection.
* God as God of the living.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation to conscience.
* Sharp polemic against fleshly wisdom.
* Pastoral address (“Ven”).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Æd, drik og vær glad, thi imorgen skulle vi dø” – Isaiah 22 / 1 Cor. 15 echo.
* “afsi Myggen og nedsluger Kamelen” – Matt. 23:24, moral blindness.
* “Guds Kraft” – not abstract power, but resurrecting, life-giving power.
* Sadducees as type of rationalistic deniers.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Gospel text presented.
* Characterization of Sadducees as deniers.
* Analogy to modern theological denial.
* Exposure of false disputation.
* Christ’s true diagnosis: ignorance of Scripture and God’s power.
* Doctrinal exposition of resurrection.
* Scriptural proof from Moses.
* Application to reader’s conscience.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Exodus 3:6 (burning bush).
* Isaiah 22:13 / 1 Corinthians 15:32.
* John 5:24–29.
* Matthew 23:24.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Rebuke retained without softening.
* Direct address maintained.
* Moral urgency preserved.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity (“maa”, “kan ikke”) rendered as must / cannot.
* Eschatological certainty preserved.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

“They knew neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.

Twenty-fourth Sunday after Trinity.

Luke 20:27–40. Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, came to him and questioned him, saying, ‘Teacher, Moses prescribed for us that if a man’s brother dies, having a wife, and he dies childless, his brother shall take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother. Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and died childless; and the second took the wife, and he also died childless; and the third took her, and likewise all seven; they left no children and died. Last of all the woman also died. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.’ And Jesus said to them, ‘The children of this world marry and are given in marriage; but those who are considered worthy to attain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, for they cannot die anymore, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. But that the dead are raised, even Moses indicated, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.’ And some of the scribes answered and said, ‘Teacher, you have spoken well.’ For they dared not ask him anything further.

The Sadducees were of that kind of people whose religion essentially consists in denial. Just as those in our own day who deny that Jesus is God, and are always ready to dispute, and with their supposed learning to demonstrate that Jesus is never expressly called God in Scripture, so the Sadducees, with their worldly wisdom, were always prepared to prove that Moses teaches nothing about the resurrection of the dead; and thus their entire religion consisted essentially in the denial of this doctrine of God.

This suited very well the fleshly life they led, to be able to convince themselves and others that there is no life after this one, that they have no accountability, and to encourage one another in the service of the belly with these words: ‘Eat, drink, and be glad, for tomorrow we shall die.’

They also believed they had very strong arguments, and thought they demonstrated their superiority when they could dispute with Jesus about the resurrection.

But it went with them as with most other theological disputants. With all their sharp-witted learning, they were ignorant of the main thing, of the catechism, so to speak; they knew neither the Scriptures nor the power of God (Mark 12:24). Whoever seriously applies himself to these two will have something else to do than to dispute.

A man who was not in every respect faithful to the truth wished to have an excuse and a defense for his falsehood. He thought that if he could first prove that an emergency lie was justified, then he could himself decide when a lie was an emergency lie.

He said to a friend: ‘A madman with an axe in his hand was pursuing another and stopped where the street divided in two, not knowing which way the pursued man had gone. There he met another person and said to him, “Tell me which way my enemy went, or I will kill you.” What should this person do? If he keeps silent, he himself will be killed; if he tells the truth, the other will be killed. Was it not necessary here to use an emergency lie?’

The friend replied: ‘I will answer yes, if you will promise me never to speak an untrue word until the above-mentioned situation occurs.’

Jesus, however, answered the Sadducees in a far more earnest and considerate manner, when they, in order to create a semblance of proof for their fleshly denial of the resurrection, produced an equally unreasonable story about the woman and the seven brothers who had been married to her.

He did not engage in their foolish and dishonest example. As was his custom, he went straight at their hearts and their condition of soul.

You Sadducees, he would say, deny the resurrection of the dead, and the reason is not that you possess any sound proof for doing so; the reason is that in your fleshly-mindedness and spiritual blindness you know neither the power of God nor the Scriptures.

If you knew the power of God and were not so clouded by your own sensuality, then you would know that life in this world and life in the world to come are two entirely different things. In this world, life—even the very best—is in fleshliness, corruptibility, and mortality. Since we all must die here, and since God’s plans of salvation could not be realized without the continuation of the human race, the Lord from the beginning gave this command: ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.’ Therefore it belongs to life in this world to marry and to give in marriage.

But there, where God has revealed his power in a human being and raised him from the dead, there begins a life in Spirit, in incorruptibility and immortality. Then death is swallowed up in victory, and the human being can no longer die, but becomes like the angels, with a transfigured, glorified body, whose nourishment is the vision of the Lord’s face. There they neither marry nor are given in marriage, because each has an eternal existence in himself.

But neither do you know the Scriptures, despite your imagined learning. You strain out the gnat and swallow the camel. The most important thing escapes your blinded eye. For it stands written in Moses, in a well-known place, that God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Can the living God be God of dead people? Then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are dead, must, according to Scripture’s own testimony, be risen to new life. ‘Therefore you are greatly mistaken.’

No wonder that both the people and the Pharisees marveled at his simplicity and authority, and that from that time on they did not dare to ask him anything further.

Friend, you are not like the Sadducees? You do not dare to deny that there is a life after this; you still believe in the resurrection of the dead, and you do well. But have you also considered what the resurrection of the dead means for you?

Do you know the Scriptures and the power of God?

Do you know that the Son of Man has been given authority to execute judgment, and that the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear the voice of the Son of God and come forth—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment (John 5:24–29)?

Thus the Scripture sounds, and thus the power is exercised.

Friend, are you prepared?”
