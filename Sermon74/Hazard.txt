STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

OVERCOMING THE DEVIL

First Sunday in Lent

Luke 10:17–20. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the devils are subject to us in your name.” And he said to them, “I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning. Behold, I give you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means harm you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice rather that your names are written in heaven.”

The realm of the Devil, and indeed of spirits in general, is not so well known as many might wish; therefore, both in ancient times and in our own days, there have been no few who, with fleshly imagination or imagined secret knowledge, have believed themselves able to explore the mysteries of the spiritual world beyond what God’s Word has revealed to us, and by their fables and pretended secrets have deceived many.

Yet enough has been revealed to us concerning the Devil and his kingdom to let us know both that all the corruption and misery of mankind have come from the Devil and his angels, and that he remains the most dangerous enemy of every individual Christian and of the whole Church, against whom we have an unceasing and irreconcilable struggle, and over whom no victory can be won except by the victory which the Son of God won when he entered the strong man’s house, “took away his full armor in which he trusted, and divided his spoil” (Luke 11:22).

This is indeed the first promise we have in God’s Word: “The seed of the woman shall crush the serpent’s head,” a prophecy that is first fulfilled when the Lord, after the temptation, could say, “Go away, Satan!” and then when he gave his disciples authority over the spirits; when he himself fought the final battle in Gethsemane and on the cross; and which continues to be fulfilled through the struggle of Christ’s body, the congregation, and all its members against the prince of evil, who has power in this world, until “the great dragon is cast down, the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world”; for he shall one day be cast down to the earth, and his angels shall be cast down with him. On this occasion John exclaims (Rev. 12:10): “Now salvation and power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Anointed have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accused them before God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even unto death.”

With regard to this struggle against the Devil and his mighty kingdom, which lies before God’s congregation and each of its members until the great day of the Lord’s judgment, Paul says (Eph. 6:12): “We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness under heaven.” Therefore put on the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the cunning assaults of the Devil (6:11). And Peter says (1 Pet. 5:8): “Be sober, be watchful; for your adversary the Devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.” And the Savior himself says (Matt. 10:28): “Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.”

But that the Son of God, by becoming man and conquering the Devil in temptation and death, has taken from him the power to destroy us, if we hold fast to Jesus, and has given us power to prevail in the struggle, if we fight only in and with Jesus—this is declared in Hebrews 2:14, where it is said: “Since the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same, so that through death he might render powerless the one who had the dominion of death, that is, the Devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage.”

Thus power is given to poor, frail children of men, whom the Son of God has cleansed and regenerated by his blood through faith, to overcome the mighty adversary the Devil and his entire host of angels who rule in this world; and what wonder, then, that the disciples, astonished and surprised by this power over the spirits which they found themselves to possess, returned to Jesus with joy and jubilation and told him of it: “Even the devils are subject to us in your name!”

But the Lord answers them with a solemn warning: It is true, Satan’s power is broken, and I saw him fall like lightning from heaven, and to you, my disciples, authority is given over serpents and scorpions—that is, over everything by which the adversary’s power could harm you. But remember, it is a dangerous power, which can lead you into the temptation to seize it as a prize to be like God, so that many will come on the great day and say: “Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out devils in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?” And then I shall have to answer: “I do not know you; depart from me, you who defile yourselves with unrighteousness.”

Therefore it is indeed a great and glorious power that is given to the Lord’s disciples, the children of God, that without fear, with the Gospel in heart and on lips, they may confidently go against all Satan’s strongholds among the heathen and in their hearts, who walk in the lust and vice of the world, and with a single word—the word of sin and grace—see them fall into dust, so that tax collectors and sinners enter the kingdom of God, and the light from heaven dawns among those who sit in the shadow and darkness of death, just as it has happened century after century and still happens to this very day—praised and blessed be the Lord for all eternity!

It is an inexpressible joy for a servant of God to see a stubborn sinner bowed into the dust by the word he has proclaimed about Jesus, and to see him crawl humbly to the cross to obtain there healing for the wounds of his heart and deliverance from the power of death and Satan. And the soul of a warrior of Christ must be lifted to heaven with jubilation when God grants him power to step forward against the kings and lords of the world and without fear bear witness to them of the King of kings, as Moses bore witness before Pharaoh, and to see their power sink into dust before that little word: Cross! from Israel’s Anointed, just as David went against Goliath and struck him down with his simple shepherd’s weapons.

But do not rejoice over this! Rather, fear! For soon you might take the power into your own hand like a raven and boast in fleshly fashion of your gifts and your piety.

There is one thing that it is sure and safe always and everywhere to rejoice in: to have the grace to be a child of God, to be preserved in childlike and simple faith amid daily sins and falls, to have a firm and confident assurance that the blood of Christ cleanses me from all sin, that I know nothing for salvation except Jesus and him crucified, and that when the outward person perishes and life hastens toward its evening, then a new and blessed time dawns for me—an eternal fellowship of life with Jesus and his Father in heaven; for I know whom I believe in, and my name is written in the Book of Life.

Brothers and sisters, let us not aspire to the high things, but hold to the lowly; and even if I should be the least and most disregarded of all the Lord’s disciples—as I know that I am the most unworthy—may the Lord grant that we day and night might ponder this one thing: how we might be preserved in the faith and one day, though scarcely, enter the kingdom of God, and daily be able to say with the Psalmist: “I would rather sit at the threshold of the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.”
