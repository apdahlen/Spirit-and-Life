STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Myndighed – not mere “authority” in institutional sense, but divinely grounded authority and power.
* Uren Aand – demon/unclean spirit with biblical-cosmological weight.
* Talsmanden – Paraclete; must retain Johannine pneumatological meaning.
* Salvelse – anointing; metaphorical and pneumatological.
* Skrøbelighed – weakness in Pauline sense, not mere frailty.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with layered causal logic.
* Parallel contrasts (folk vs. Jesus; doctrine vs. prayer).
* Embedded Scripture quotations integrated into argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of Holy Spirit, regeneration, prayer, authority of Christ.
* Distinction between outward miracles and inward salvation.
* Union with Christ; sonship.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran sermon tone.
* Appeals to conscience and pastoral urgency.
* Avoiding modern smoothing or abstraction.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Lydende Malm og klingende Bjelde” – 1 Cor. 13; empty loveless preaching.
* “Aanden uden Maal” – John 3:34; fullness of Spirit.
* “Veien og Sandheden og Livet” – John 14:6 echo.
* “Gaa ud i Ørkenen” – metaphor for mission to the lost.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Contrast between people’s impression and Jesus’ inner life.
* Diagnosis of scribal preaching’s weakness.
* Christ as Word incarnate.
* Authority grounded in prayerful sonship.
* Application to ministry and church.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Mark 1:21–35 (base text)
* Matt. 23:2–3; Matt. 5:17
* John 7:46; John 14:6, 12
* Luke 10:20
* 1 Cor. 2:4; 13
* Heb. 2:14–15

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain warning against powerless orthodoxy.
* Preserve gravity of spiritual authority.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “kan ingen,” “maa,” “alene ved” rendered with full necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Myndighed = authority
* Helligaand = Holy Spirit
* Bøn = prayer

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sword imagery, anointing, wilderness, Father’s house preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward false authority; consolation in sonship.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where argument accumulates.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

A Doctrine with Authority.

Third Sunday after Epiphany.

Mark 1:21–35.

And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. And they were exceedingly astonished at his doctrine; for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. And the unclean spirit convulsed him, and cried with a loud voice, and came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. And immediately his fame spread throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee. And immediately they left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. And he came and took her by the hand and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she served them. And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. And the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a solitary place, and there he prayed.

It is especially the first two and the last verse of this text that we shall here consider. Between them lies the account of how Jesus cast out “an unclean spirit,” healed Peter’s mother-in-law, and—after the report of him had spread throughout all Galilee—how in the evening the whole city of Capernaum was gathered before his door, and he healed many sick and possessed among them.

On the one side, the people’s impression of Jesus’ doctrine and work: they were greatly astonished, they were all seized with fear—it was a “new doctrine”; he taught as one who has authority, and “not as the scribes.”

On the other side, the Son of God, the Son of Man, in his humble rest and childlike devotion to God, his Father: he “went to a solitary place and prayed there.”

“Doctrine with authority” and “prayer”!

“Out of the mouth of infants and nursing children you have prepared praise,” was Jesus’ answer when the chief priests and scribes complained that the children greeted him with Hosanna in the temple. Children sometimes know Jesus better than scribes.

The people who heard Jesus’ discourses and saw his signs received an impression such as they had never received from the sermons of the scribes. Was this because the latter taught false doctrine? The Lord himself says (Matt. 23:2–3): “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; therefore do and observe whatever they tell you, but not the works they do; for they say, but do not do.”

Their doctrine was therefore correct enough, but their heart was not in their words; their words were sound in teaching, yet at the same time only sounding brass and a clanging cymbal, because they lacked the love that is poured into hearts by the Holy Spirit of God. Their preaching was indeed both thorough and well supported by passages of the Law, but it was barren and powerless, because it lacked the force of personal conviction. It did not come from the heart and did not go to the heart.

It was otherwise with Jesus. He not only taught rightly according to the Law, but he also revealed its spiritual content; for he had come to fulfill the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 5:17). He was not only driven by the Holy Spirit of God; he had “the Spirit without measure” and was one with God himself. His words were not merely the fruit of his personal conviction; rather, his person and his words were one—he himself was the Word, just as his person itself was the Way and the Truth and the Life.

Therefore his words made such a mighty impression on the people that they said, “Never has a man spoken like this man” (John 7:46); “he spoke as one who had authority.” The words from Jesus’ mouth passed like a two-edged sword through their consciences, and when they saw the unclean spirits depart at his command, they were all terrified and asked one another: “What is this new doctrine?”—a doctrine with authority and power.

But when the crowds had been gathered around him to receive relief and healing from his gentle and mighty hand also for their bodily diseases, he withdrew in the solitude of the night in order to draw new strength in childlike and intimate fellowship with his Father in heaven. There he found the strength that made his words a doctrine with authority—there he daily sought new power for the great conflict he was to undergo with him who had the power of death, and to gain authority “to deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage,” and “to save completely those who come to the Father through him.” This is the true “doctrine with authority”; it comes from Jesus’ intimate filial relationship with the Father.

“Do not rejoice in this,” says the Lord to the returning seventy disciples, “that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven” (Luke 10:20).

The great miracle is not that unclean spirits are cast out, that the sick are healed, or that the dead are raised bodily; the great miracle occurs when a soul is saved by the blood of Jesus, and the angels in heaven also rejoice greatly when “one sinner repents.” Therefore the Lord also says to his disciples: “Whoever believes in me will do the works that I do, and he will do greater works than these, because I go to the Father” (John 14:12).

What works are greater than those Jesus did? It is to proclaim Christ crucified and risen, a Savior for sinners. For this cannot take place until Jesus on the one hand has truly died and been raised, and on the other hand has sent someone his Holy Spirit to carry out his work.

Therefore he also says: “It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you” (John 16:7).

Without the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, there is therefore no one who can be a true disciple and perform the greatest of all works, to proclaim salvation through the blood of Jesus, “not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power” (1 Cor. 2:4); for without the Holy Spirit no one knows Jesus, the Son, since “no one can call Jesus Lord except by the Holy Spirit.” And without that same Spirit no one knows God, the Father; for only by this Spirit can we cry, “Abba, Father!” Only by this Spirit can we have that childlike, intimate, heartfelt fellowship with God which the Son himself had, and which is called prayer. In such a daily and unceasing life of prayer, a child of God finds the power by which he can do greater works than these, namely the love of God that is poured into the hearts of believers by the Holy Spirit,

so that for Jesus’ sake and in his stead they are ready to go out into the wilderness and seek the lost sons and daughters, and on the strong shoulders of the Gospel carry them home to the Father’s house.

Therefore no one can carry on a true and living proclamation of the Gospel unless he himself through faith has become one with Jesus Christ, made a partaker in the power of his death and resurrection, and with him a son in the Father’s house, so that in the anointing and conviction of the Holy Spirit he can testify to what he himself has seen and heard.

But if someone in such unity of faith and Spirit with the Father and the Son boldly preaches the Gospel to the poor—let it be that “his body is weak and his speech mediocre”—then he shall experience that the Lord is today and yesterday, yes, to all eternity the same; that his power, which with a word drove out evil spirits, dwells in him; and that his strength is perfected in weakness. And when such a messenger in Christ’s stead, in heartfelt love, pursues souls and in unceasing prayer cries out for their salvation and daily humbles himself in the dust before the living God, then the same testimony shall meet him from the mouth of the people as once met the Lord himself:

“You speak as one who has authority, and not as the scribes.”

Brothers and sisters, should we not pray to God that this “doctrine with authority” may become more and more the reigning one among us, in all congregations and in all lands?
