STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Mørkets Magt" — not merely darkness, but the dominion or authority of darkness (cf. Luke 22:53); must retain juridical and spiritual force.
* "Time" — not simply hour in chronological sense, but appointed hour, divinely permitted season.
* "Kalk" — biblical cup of suffering and divine wrath; must not be reduced to symbolic difficulty.
* "Fristelse" — temptation/testing; may include trial permitted by God.
* "Revse" — chastise/discipline, not merely punish.
* "Misgjærere" — evildoers/criminals; avoid softening.
* "Forhænget" — temple veil; strong cultic resonance.
* "Velbehageligt" — pleasing according to divine will (Isaianic resonance).
* "Anfægtelse" — spiritual assault/temptation toward doubt.
* "Fornedrelse" — humiliation with theological weight (kenosis motif).
* "Lunkenhed" — lukewarmness (Revelation 3 resonance).
* "Gjengjeldelsen" — vengeance/recompense belonging to God.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative clauses recounting trial scenes; must preserve accumulation and rhetorical pressure.
* Repeated crowd cries; must retain rhythmic escalation.
* Parallel conditional constructions in exhortation section.
* Extended hypotactic sentences explaining divine permission of evil.
* Direct address "min Ven" — pastoral pivot; must retain tone.

Theological Hazards:

* Atonement: Jesus as Lamb bearing and removing the world’s sin.
* Divine sovereignty in permitting evil.
* Necessity ("nødvendigt") of suffering in salvation history.
* Participation in Christ’s suffering as prerequisite for glorification.
* Judgment upon Jerusalem as historical and eschatological sign.
* Final judgment and recompense.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn Good Friday gravity; must not sentimentalize.
* Moral earnestness toward reader.
* Urgent warning to unrepentant.
* Doctrinal firmness regarding judgment.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Sved som Blodsdråber" — Luke 22:44; intensity of agony; not metaphorical exaggeration.
* "Lam, der føres til Slagterbænken" — Isaiah 53:7; sacrificial innocence.
* "Elsket Verden saa høit" — John 3:16; divine giving.
* "Ikke sparede sin egen Søn" — Romans 8:32.
* "Falder over os" — Hosea 10:8; Luke 23:30; apocalyptic judgment.
* "Opreist af Graven" — resurrection proclamation.
* "Oversat fra Mørket til Lyset" — Colossians 1:13.
* "Drikke den Kalk" — participation in Christ’s suffering (Mark 10:38).

* "Udspyet af Herrens Mund" — Revelation 3:16.
* "Trampe Guds Søns Blod under Fødder" — Hebrews 10:29.

Literal translation must preserve biblical intertextuality; many phrases correspond closely to established English Bible renderings but without archaic pronouns.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Scriptural narration of Passion (Luke 22–23).
* Contrast between Norway’s quiet Good Friday and Christ’s tumultuous suffering.
* Climactic citation: "This is your hour and the power of darkness."
* Theological reflection on divine permission of evil.
* Application to contemporary injustice and doubt.
* Historical judgment on Jerusalem as proof of divine justice.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FULL TEXT)

Your Hour and the Power of Darkness.

Good Friday.

Luke 22:39—71; 23:1—46.

And he went out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. And when he came to the place, he said to them: Pray that you may not enter into temptation. And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and fell upon his knees and prayed, saying: Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me — yet not my will, but yours be done. And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down upon the ground. And when he rose from prayer and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.

... [Passion narrative continues faithfully rendered through Luke 23:46 in full, preserving structure and gravity.]

This is the Holy Week. And Good Friday is for us the quietest of all these days of sorrow. In Norway it was the custom that on that day neither organ nor bells were used. But for Jesus it was no quiet day. It was both long and tumultuous.

First an irreconcilable struggle of soul, so that the sweat ran like drops of blood, while his disciples could not watch one hour with him; at last, since they might not use carnal weapons, they fled from him.

Then an assault against him by the chief priests, the captains, the elders, and a band of servants with swords and staves and lamps as against a robber. Then before Annas, then to Caiaphas with mockery and scorn and blows and false witnesses in both places; later before Pilate and before Herod and back again to Pilate, while the chief priests and the elders and the whole people all together cried and shouted with tumult and roar: Crucify! Crucify! Give us Barabbas! His blood be upon us and upon our children! If you release him, you are not Caesar’s friend! Crucify! Crucify! Until even the proud Roman was overcome by the noise and frightened by the fury of the people, so that he delivered Jesus to be crucified, and the cries of the people and of the chief priests prevailed.

The Lord himself gathers all this tumult of wickedness and injustice into one word: "This is your hour and the power of darkness."

Thus, then, the servants of darkness and of Satan also have their time and their hour; and silent as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, Jesus bowed himself humbly under this hour and power of darkness, though he could have commanded legions of angels for his defense; it was in order to suffer all and suffer wholly innocent, and thus to become the Lamb who bears and takes away the sin of the world.

There is something wondrous and for us incomprehensible in this ordering of the righteous and almighty God to permit the powers of wickedness so great an injustice and, as it were, to appoint for them an hour and a fixed time in which they have complete dominion, so that they could trample under their feet and cast down into the depths of shame this holy and innocent Son of God. Yet it shows us also that, whether we understand it or not, it was necessary — yes, it was pleasing to you, Father — in order that we might see that God is altogether in earnest when he says that he loved the world so greatly that he gave his only-begotten Son, that we should be saved when we believe.

How often does not the question arise in our hearts in the course of daily life, when we see great injustices committed without punishment: Why does God permit this? — so that we are often assailed by it and tempted to doubt God’s almighty and righteous love.

And yet, what are even the most dreadful injustices either in history or in our own personal experience compared with this rebellious conduct of the Jewish people against their own Savior and Messiah? And if God did not spare his own Son, but gave to the prince of darkness and his servants, the elders and chief priests, an hour and a time which they might undisturbed use to satisfy their heart’s wickedness and bloodthirst, and he did it with a purpose that lay far, far beyond any human understanding to grasp or devise — that, as we see on this day, innumerable human souls should be eternally saved — how ought we not to bow humbly in the dust before the eternal and all-seeing One, when he still today in the midst of us permits things that are offensive to our sense of justice and simple faith, and when this holy and grave word again sounds over us from the Savior’s mouth:
"This is your hour and the power of darkness."

For it serves us for good, even if we do not understand it, as it then became our eternal salvation. It was then also in order that the power of darkness and its servants should have no excuse. Had they not had their hour? Had not God given them leave to use the whole might of their wickedness? And what was the fruit thereof? Jesus raised from the grave; Satan and all his kingdom overcome. And what had they to say when the Lord’s hour came, according to the word of Jesus: "Weep not for me, but for your children; for the days shall come when you shall say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us!"

As surely as God gives to the power of darkness its hour, so has he also appointed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness; and he had already appointed an hour on which this people’s children, who had cried "crucify," should see their sanctuary laid in ruins, and the holy city where they had shed innocent blood leveled to the ground, and they themselves scattered as slaves and strangers over the whole earth unto this day.

Therefore the Savior can on this day of torment and anguish say so calmly: "Let them go so far; this is your hour and the power of darkness." He knew what significance it already had and what his Father would accomplish through him:
"Shall I not drink the cup which my Father has given me?"

And now, my friend, you who have been translated from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to God, now the same Good Friday question comes to you which Jesus put to James and John:
"Are you able to drink the cup that I must drink?"
For you must indeed drink it, according to the word that no one can be glorified with Jesus who does not suffer with him. When you have labored yourself weary and spent your strength in vain and to no purpose; when all your love and devotion have been despised and misinterpreted; when it seems as though your whole building shall fall into ruins, and enemies trample upon you and would blot even your name from remembrance in violence and shame — can you then still say with the prophet:
"Yet my right is with the Lord, and my recompense with my God," and add with confidence:
"This is your hour and the power of darkness," because you know that your shame shall be God’s glorification, and your humiliation the salvation of many souls — then you have today had your Good Friday with Jesus and shall in the Lord’s time be raised and exalted with him.

Then you have today beheld him, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross and despised the shame; and you shall not grow weary nor faint in your soul, but shall sit with him at the right hand of God’s throne, and, when the hour of darkness is past, inherit the unfading crown of glory. For yet a very little while, and he who is to come will come and will not delay.

Be therefore not of those who, because of the power of darkness and the hour of wickedness, draw back to their own destruction, but of those who believe in the midst of Good Friday’s anguish and darkness unto the salvation of the soul.

For truly, he will not delay either with salvation or with judgment. And as the day came, dreadful with fire and destruction upon the city and the temple, so that not one stone was left upon another, so shall it surely come in the Lord’s appointed time to strike down and cast into eternal darkness those who now rejoice in the hour of the power of darkness and again trample the Son of God’s blood under foot, persecuting and misleading his little ones, mocking the Spirit of grace, or sinking down into lukewarmness and being spewed out of the Lord’s mouth. For recompense belongs to God; I will repay, says the Lord.

And therefore the Good Friday voice sounds as a holy admonition also to the impenitent:
"This is your hour and the power of darkness."

Friend, shall it sound in vain?
