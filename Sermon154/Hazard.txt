STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Selvfornægtelse – more than “self-denial”; includes total renunciation of the self before God.
* Verdensforsagelse – not mere detachment, but renunciation of the world in a salvific sense.
* Salighed / salig – blessedness in the eternal, salvific sense; not mere happiness.
* Fortabelse – eternal perdition, not misfortune.
* Sandselighed – sensuality in moral-theological sense; life oriented toward sense-desire.
* Forfængelighed – vanity in biblical sense (cf. Ecclesiastes), not mere pride.
* Trældom – bondage, slavery (Rom. 6 resonance).
* Retfærdig / retskaffen – outward moral uprightness, not saving righteousness.
* Besøgelsestid – time of visitation (Luke 19:44 resonance).
* Lidelser Samfund – fellowship/communion in Christ’s sufferings (Phil. 3:10).
* Opreisning – resurrection/restoration, not mere encouragement.
* Tugter – chastens (Heb. 12 resonance).
* Timelig / Forkrænkelig – temporal / perishable (1 Cor. 15 resonance).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with doctrinal escalation.
* Parallel clauses contrasting salvation and perdition.
* Rhetorical imperatives (“Gaa med til Golgata… se… skjælv…”).
* Sermonic pacing built through repetition (“da vil… da vil…”).
* Conditional constructions with moral inevitability.

Theological Hazards:

* Losing one’s life vs. finding it (Matt. 16:25).
* Distinction between natural life and life in God.
* Self-denial as death with Christ (Rom. 6; Gal. 2:20).
* World-renunciation as necessary for salvation.
* Chastening as gracious divine discipline.
* Love as indispensable mark of true Christianity (1 Cor. 13).

Voice Hazards:

* Risk of softening warnings about eternal torment.
* Risk of psychologizing repentance instead of presenting objective wrath.
* Risk of sentimentalizing Lazarus imagery.
* Risk of reducing exhortation to reflective meditation instead of urgent appeal.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “tage sit Kors op” – take up one’s cross (Matt. 16:24); must retain cruciform seriousness.
* “det grønne Træ… det tørre” – Luke 23:31; Christ as green tree, sinner as dry.
* “falde i den levende Guds Hænder” – Heb. 10:31.
* “Menneskens Søn” – Son of Man (Dan. 7; Matt. 16:27).
* “Besøgelsestid” – Luke 19:44.
* “Kobbermur og Jernpille” – Jer. 1:18.
* “Lazarus, fuld af Saar” – Luke 16.
* “Herre, frels mig, jeg forgaaer!” – Matt. 8:25 echo.
* “Verden forgaar med dens Lyst” – 1 John 2:17.

Literal translation must preserve biblical phrasing without archaic English pronouns.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening: Contrast rich man and Lazarus; explanation through present text.
* Thesis: Three necessities—self-denial, renunciation of world, following Jesus.
* Contrast: Worldly self-denial vs. Christian self-denial.
* Doctrinal exposition: Natural life as life in sin.

* Expansion into world-renunciation (inner and outer cross).
* Divine chastening as mercy.
* Third necessity: following Jesus in love.
* Warning against loveless asceticism.
* Concluding eschatological horizon: Son of Man’s return.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

Self-Denial and Renunciation of the World.
First Sunday after Trinity.

Matthew 16:24–27.

Then Jesus said to his disciples: If anyone will come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake shall find it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and suffers loss of his soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he shall repay each according to his deed.

The old text for the First Sunday after Trinity we all know; it is about the rich man and Lazarus. The rich man’s joyful life ended in eternal torment; Lazarus’s wretched existence ended in eternal blessedness. In our text today the reason is explained why it came to so different an end with the rich man and Lazarus.

He who would attain an eternal glory must deny himself, renounce the world, and follow Jesus. These three things are required for the one who desires to reach the eternal life.

But he who would satisfy his own desire and seize the world’s passing joy cannot expect that eternal glory shall crown a life which has been spent in the pleasures of sensuality and the bondage of vanity.

The narrow way of life is self-denial. But it is self-denial in the footsteps of Jesus, and it is wholly different from that self-denial which the world also knows. Many have denied themselves in many directions, afflicted themselves, relinquished pleasures and comforts for the sake of worldly aims. This is often highly esteemed in the world, if it is crowned with success; it is often adorned with honorable names; it is called strength of character and perseverance, it is called frugality and self-sacrifice; but it is not the full and unconditional self-denial of which Jesus speaks. That goes infinitely further; for it does not consist in denying oneself in certain directions in order thereby to attain so much greater enjoyments in other directions; but herein it consists, that I wholly and entirely relinquish my own self, myself, in order that God may become my all in all. For to deny oneself in the Christian sense is to lose one’s life.

The natural man lives for his own pleasure in the service of sensuality and vanity. His sorrows and cares, his joys and satisfactions, his desires and strivings are all within the sphere of sensuality and temporality. And because the natural man in all this, in work, in sorrow, in joy, in distress and in desire, lives without God and transgresses his commandments, therefore this whole natural life is a life in sin, be it ever so outwardly upright. He who would be saved must lose this life; not simply by dying the bodily death; for he who by compulsion loses that to which his heart clings does not become glad, but sorrowful; he does not become happy, but miserable; he does not become blessed, but accursed; he is not saved, but lost. Therefore it is not the bodily death which delivers from the bondage of sensuality with its pain and its pleasure; but it is the death of self-denial at Christ’s cross.

Go with him to Golgotha and learn what it is to be a sinner before God; see what has happened to God’s Son, to the green tree, and tremble when you think what shall happen to you, who are the dry. Open your eyes fully and see that your life in sin and sensuality, that life which you live for your own pleasure, is a life under God’s wrath and ends in eternal torment. Learn what it means that the world passes away with its lust; see what it is to fall into the hands of the living God. Then your proud heart shall be bowed and your self-willed will broken; then you shall receive a broken heart and a contrite spirit; then you lose your old life in the service of sensuality and vanity; for then you begin to feel the dread and terror of eternity; then you see your own helplessness when the abysses open around you on every side; then true self-denial is learned, when you sink helpless, broken, lost down at Christ’s cross and lift your praying hands to him: Lord, save me, I perish!

That is the hour of self-denial; then the whole old life is lost. Thereafter it continues unceasingly to be a life in self-denial, a life of renunciation of oneself, a life in fellowship with Christ’s sufferings.

Thus the narrow way of life becomes also a way of renunciation of the world, a way of the cross. For he who dies with Christ from himself, he dies also from the world. Eternity has become his all; to flee an eternal perdition, to attain an eternal blessedness, that is what matters, and nothing else. He has become a child of God, heaven is his fatherland, and in order to reach it he turns his back upon the world. But to live outside the world and yet be in the world, that is the inner cross which belongs to all Christians. And to bear the world’s contempt and scorn because one has despised the world, that is the outer cross at which no Christian ought to take offense. For if you turned your back upon the world in order to go toward heaven’s blessedness, can you expect anything else than that the world rages and hates, when it has spread out its glory before you in vain and enticed you with its pleasure?

And it is not enough that the Christian tastes renunciation of the world in this form. It is not only this that a Christian must bear, that inwardly loosed from the world he becomes the world’s mockery and men’s contempt. But since it will often happen that the deceitful heart again fastens itself upon the temporal and perishable things, the Lord deals graciously with his children and spares them temptations and chastens them for falls, in that he lets poverty and sickness and sorrow fall upon them, so that they become as Lazarus, full of sores. This is no burden for the one who strives forward toward eternity’s glory; it is a relief for the spirit because it oppresses the flesh. It drives away from the world of perishability forward toward the glory, if it is truly used in Christ’s mind. The Lord takes away what has become for us a temptation which we could not endure; let us beware lest sorrow over the loss become a new temptation in which we fall and are lost.

But the third thing which belongs to the narrow way of life is to follow Jesus. Without this there is no profit either in self-denial or in renunciation of the world. For to follow Jesus is to live the life of love after him; to love the Father in heaven, to love the people on earth; to love God who hates sin, to love sinners who are perishing in their sins under God’s wrath. If our self-denial and renunciation of the world are not borne and governed, not permeated and animated by Christ’s love, then they are nothing; as Paul says: If I distribute all my goods to the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.

It is a sorrowful existence to live in self-denial and renunciation of the world without Christ’s love. It becomes a hard and cold, a bitter and evil, a heartless and spiritless existence, which indeed with great certainty claims to be Christianity, but alas, alas, it is not. It has Christianity’s pain, but it lacks its joy; it has taken the bitter, but it has neglected the sweet; it has learned to know sin and death and perdition; but it has not experienced grace and restoration and blessedness. O what misery, what unhappy condition! You have halted halfway, dear soul; you have let go of the world, but you have not grasped Christ; you have lost your life, but you have not received God’s life in its stead. For God’s life is the life of love in the Holy Spirit.

It is not enough to deny yourself; you must also sacrifice yourself for Christ’s cause; it is not enough to renounce the world, you must also take all the worldly and earthly things you have and use them in Christ’s service. It avails nothing that you yourself do not have your joy in riches and the world’s goods, if you let your wealth lie unused where it could clothe the naked and feed the hungry. It avails nothing that you live simply and frugally, if you only let it be a dead treasure with you, which others consume in their pleasures. O no, follow Jesus’ example and step in his footsteps! See how they drip with blessing! Then your life in self-denial and renunciation of the world shall also become a blessed life, when it is also a life in following Christ.

When your heart closes itself seriously, manfully and resolutely against the world’s pleasure, O let it spread itself freely and blessedly in living love toward your heavenly Father and toward your fellow human beings. When you are as a bronze wall and an iron pillar against the powers of evil, O be loving and gentle toward the poor sinner, man or woman, whom Satan has bound in his chains and ensnared in his nets. When you hate sin, yet have compassion upon the sinner. When you rebuke Jerusalem’s sin, O do it with tears in your eye and weeping in your heart, because Jerusalem did not know the time of its visitation.

Self-denial and renunciation of the world must find their purification and interpretation in following Christ; for it is no Christianity to die with him if we do not also live with him. But Christ’s life is Christ’s love. May it become our life, and then it shall also become our blessedness, when the Son of Man shall come in his Father’s glory with his angels and repay each according to his deed.
