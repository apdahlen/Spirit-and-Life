THE YEAR OF THE LORD’S FAVOR

First Sunday in Advent

Luke 4:16–22. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and according to his custom he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read. And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him, and when he opened the book, he found the place where it was written: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim the Gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal those who are brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” And he closed the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them: Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. And all bore witness to him and marveled at the gracious words that proceeded from his mouth.

Will the new church year that begins today become a year of the Lord’s favor for our church?

The answer to this question depends on two things. The one is whether the Lord, “according to his custom,” will come into our synagogues—that is, our congregations—and there let the Word sound forth for us. The other is whether we give the Word room in our hearts, so that the Word becomes for us a power unto salvation.

Blessed be the Lord, that the year of the Lord’s favor, which began with his gracious preaching in Nazareth, has not yet come to an end. From that time it has been the year of the Lord’s favor, inasmuch as the Gospel since then has sounded forth in an ever-widening circle. From Sunday to Sunday, from year to year, from century to century, preaching with power from God and heavenly Spirit has resounded over the earth in thousands and again thousands of places.

Blessed be the Lord, that it still resounds. And that it resounds with its old, simple, and life‑blessed content. Even if it has at times been darkened and overshadowed by human commandments and human doctrines, it has nevertheless not fallen silent; but as the sun breaks forth again from mist and clouds, so the clear radiance of the Gospel has by the Lord’s grace again shone forth. Still the Lord, through his Gospel, offers the kingdom of God with all its grace and gift to the poor; still he offers healing and restoration to broken hearts; still he offers sight to the blind and freedom to the oppressed; still he opens his Savior’s arms and says: “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” Grace for every poor sinner, free grace, unmerited grace, remains the sum of the preaching, as it always was. The same old distress that again and again afflicts and presses human hearts can still be relieved by the same old faithful remedy, the precious blood of Jesus, which blots out all our transgressions and atones for all our guilt.

Therefore it has hitherto been the year of the Lord’s favor for all of us who dwell in lands that are illumined by the true light of the Gospel, where the Lord’s pure Word and blessed Gospel sound forth in the congregation from the mouths of the Lord’s faithful witnesses. But there are also places from which the Lord has removed the lampstand, and where the Gospel no longer sounds. Where now are Nazareth and Capernaum? Where are Jerusalem and Bethlehem? Where are Ephesus and Antioch and Smyrna? Where are even Rome and Alexandria? Therefore, you who have the light, do not be proud, but fear! Thank the Lord, who has allowed you to keep the light; but pray—pray in deepest humility—that he will allow you to keep the light “yet this year.”

And blessed be the Lord, we dare, despite our sins and our lukewarmness, nevertheless believe that he will still, “according to his custom,” come into our synagogues every Sunday and let the Word be read and preached for us. We may say with confidence that the Lord will still spare us, that he will let the new church year be “the year of the Lord’s favor.” He has not forgotten to show mercy, and he will not close the door of grace. Therefore we still proclaim, in faith and in the Spirit of Christ, the year of the Lord’s favor with Word and Baptism and Holy Supper, and with the blessed preaching of Jesus’ witnesses. But will it also become the year of the Lord’s favor for you? Dear soul, consider this question well. There are so many—so many—who are part of God’s congregation and who take part in much of its work, but who do not share in its joy and blessedness. Why should this be so? If you bear the congregation’s burdens, then also take its goods and joys, and so it will become the year of the Lord’s favor for you.

How can this come to pass? Perhaps you could learn something by simply following our text. Jesus went, “according to his custom, on the Sabbath day into the synagogue.” You should begin with the same custom; perhaps you do not yet have this custom. One often speaks so contemptuously of habitual Christianity, and it is indeed true that it is a poor Christianity. But there are habits that are useful for the Christian life. Among them is this custom of Jesus Christ, to go into the synagogue on the Sabbath day. Follow it in full earnestness in the new church year, and do not let laziness or sluggishness or bad weather hinder you from gathering with God’s congregation in the Lord’s house. And even if the pastor cannot be present in the congregation’s assembly every Sunday, let that not hinder the congregation from gathering for its edification. The Word can indeed be read and work nonetheless.

But it is not accomplished with a good habit alone. If it is to become the year of the Lord’s favor for you, then the question is whether you will become one of the poor and brokenhearted, for whom there is Gospel and heart‑peace to be found. If you go rich and satisfied and cheerful through the new church year, then it will not become better for you than all the other years. If your heart is great and strong and hard and whole, so that the Word finds no room in it, then it will not become otherwise than it has been; for with every day that passes, and with every word you hear without repentance and faith, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of God’s righteous revelation. If the new church year is to become for you a year of the Lord’s favor, then bow, you proud heart, under the Lord’s law that judges your sin; then let Christ’s love melt the ice around the heart, so that you flee broken and poor to the cross and the blood.

Can a sinner then do anything for his salvation, you say. Must he not wait until the Spirit of the Lord seizes him so powerfully that he cannot resist? Must he not wait until a storm of awakening sweeps over land and people? — But have you not heard of him who stands at the door and knocks? Shall he stand outside even longer? He brings salvation with him; he brings healing with him; he brings heart‑peace and blessedness with him; you can take nothing—absolutely nothing—but you can receive everything from him; oh, open up, open up, that he may come in. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear! And if you hear rightly, then the Word gives faith and peace and life.

A man stands in the shade and freezes and trembles; a friend comes and says to him: “On the other side there is sunshine and warmth—go there.” And the man goes; he perhaps does not perceive any effect of the sun at once; but if he waits a little while, then the warmth of the sun begins to do him good. Have you tried the same with God’s Gospel? You go to church a single time; you leaf casually through your Bible; you perceive nothing. But remain standing in the light; give the Word time; hear it diligently and read it yet more diligently, and it shall itself plow the ground and break the stone crust and lay living seed down in the field of the heart. Let it be watered with tears and weeping over your own hardness, and the seed shall grow the better. Pray and wait in faith and hope, and the year of the Lord’s favor shall also become your favorable year, your day of salvation and the times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord.

May the Lord grant us a blessed church year with new glad tidings for our sorrowing and wounded hearts.
