STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Faarestien" – sheepfold; carries biblical resonance (John 10), not merely a pen.
* "Røver" – robber/bandit; moral and spiritual weight.
* "Enfold" – simplicity/guilelessness, not foolishness.
* "Disciple" – disciples; retain biblical register.
* "Forjættet" – promised (solemn, covenantal tone).
* "Den Helligaand" – the Holy Spirit; doctrinal precision required.
* "Enfoldige og umyndige" – simple and immature; spiritual childlikeness, not contempt.
* "Salig" / "Salighed" – saved/blessed; must retain soteriological force.
* "Korsfæstede og gjenopstandne Legeme" – crucified and risen body; incarnational emphasis.
* "Egenretfærdighed" – self-righteousness; key Lutheran polemic term.
* "Sønneret" / "Barneret" – filial right/sonship; juridical and relational nuance.
* "Forkrænkeligheden" – corruption/mortality; Pauline resonance.
* "Kaldsgjerning" – vocation; Lutheran doctrine of calling.
* "Forbandelsens Træ" – tree of the curse; Galatians echo.
* "Naade over Naade" – grace upon grace (John 1:16).
* "Benaadede Synder" – pardoned/graced sinner; paradox central to Lutheran theology.
* "Børnelærdom" – elementary principles; Gal. 4 resonance.
* "Indhegning" – enclosure; pastoral protection imagery.
* "Uforfænkelighed" – incorruptibility.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long accumulative sentences with theological layering.
* Semicolon-driven reasoning requiring preservation of logical buildup.
* Repeated "hvad enten..." structures (whether... or...) forming rhythmic totality.
* Rhetorical questions addressing the reader’s conscience.
* Alternation between exposition and direct exhortation.

Theological Hazards:

* Exclusivity of Christ as sole access to the Father.
* Justification by faith versus external church affiliation.
* Personal appropriation of salvation.
* Union with Christ (personal, relational salvation).
* Perseverance and divine preservation.
* Conflict with Law and return to bondage (Gal. 4).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest address: "O, Ven" – intimate pastoral exhortation.
* High solemnity without sentimentality.
* Warning against false security.
* Doctrinal firmness against rationalism and theological suspicion.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Grønne Græsgange og stille rindende Vande" – Psalm 23 imagery; retain pastoral biblical resonance.
* "Fra Forbandelsens Træ til den aabnede Grav" – from cross to resurrection; redemptive movement.
* "Liv af Døde" – life from the dead; Pauline (Rom. 11:15).
* "Naade over Naade" – John 1:16; use established rendering.
* "Æder sure Druer" – Ezek. 18; personal responsibility for sin.
* "Trælle under den" – bondage under the law; Gal. 4.
* "Klippe og et Horn for Israel" – Psalmic divine strength imagery.
* "Skjule sig i hans Saar" – devotional pietistic image of refuge in Christ’s wounds.
* "Korsfæstet ham paany" – Hebrews 6:6 echo.

Literal renderings would obscure force where relational warmth or doctrinal exclusivity is central; biblical cadence should guide English equivalents.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening: Presentation of two parables and their difficulty.
* Contrast: Learned theologian vs. simple believer.
* Doctrinal tension: Christ as Door, Shepherd, Doorkeeper.
* Explanation of exclusivity of access through Christ.
* Description of filial freedom and inheritance.
* Expansion: Christ as living Door granting life.
* Transition: From Door to Shepherd – relational salvation.
* Emphasis on personal salvation, not communal formalism.
* Intensified personal appeal: called by name.
* Mutual knowledge and perseverance.
* Christ as Doorkeeper – protection amid enemies.
* Climactic assurance (Romans 8 echo).
* Final direct question to the reader.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 10:1–10 (primary text).
* John 14:6 – no access to the Father except through the Son.
* Psalm 23 – green pastures, still waters.
* Galatians 3:13 – tree of curse.
* John 1:16 – grace upon grace.
* Ezekiel 18 – sour grapes.
* Matthew 9:2 – "your sins are forgiven."
* Luke 15 – shepherd seeking lost sheep.
* Galatians 4:9 – weak and beggarly elements.
* Luke 12:32 – little flock.

* Hebrews 6:6 – crucify again.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp rhetorical questioning.
* Preserve direct address and warning.
* Maintain exclusivity claims without dilution.
* Let assurance arise from doctrinal certainty, not emotional exaggeration.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" → shall (retain firmness).
* "maa" → must.
* "kan" in negations → cannot.
* Preserve inevitability in salvation language.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Salig/Salighed → saved/salvation.
* Naade → grace.
* Tro → faith.
* Hyrde → Shepherd.
* Dør → Door.
* Barneret/Sønneret → filial right/sonship.
* Liv → life (eternal life where context demands).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve Door, Shepherd, pasture, wounds, rock, horn.
* Avoid explanatory paraphrase.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Alternate severity (warning) and consolation (assurance).
* Maintain pastoral warmth alongside doctrinal rigor.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long cumulative sentences where argument builds.
* Preserve "whether… or…" rhythmic structures.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The Shepherd and the Sheep.

Second Sunday after Easter.

John 10:1–10. Truly, truly, I say to you: He who does not enter by the Door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the Door is the Shepherd of the sheep. To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. And when he has driven out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. But a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers. This parable Jesus spoke to them; but they did not understand what it was that he spoke to them. Then Jesus said again to them: Truly, truly, I say to you: I am the Door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. I am the Door; if anyone enters through me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and have abundance.

Here we have from the Lord’s own mouth two parables which, with all their authoritative and arresting content and all their simplicity, were nevertheless incomprehensible to the Lord’s own disciples and have since caused the theological interpreters great difficulty. It was precisely on account of these things that Jesus had promised his disciples the Holy Spirit, who should teach them all things and remind them of all that he had spoken to them. And when the learned man suspiciously wrestles with the apparent lack of logic in the Word of God, the simple and immature leaps over all difficulties and finds also in these two parables green pastures and still flowing waters for refreshment and rest for his weary soul.

It appears irreconcilable with human reasoning that the Lord calls himself both “the Door” and “the Shepherd of the sheep” and “the Doorkeeper.” But for the one who knows that there is no access to the Father except through the Son, that there is no entrance into heaven except through the crucified and risen body of Jesus, that there is no one who can give to him who hungers to eat or to him who thirsts to drink except Jesus, and that no one can defend and protect his sheep except he who has overcome the devil and taken his armor from him—for him it is in faith both rightly intelligible and exceedingly precious that Jesus calls himself at once the Door and the Shepherd of the sheep and the Doorkeeper.

For first, there is only one Door to the kingdom of heaven; human reason, self‑righteousness, and pride have indeed continually labored to fashion new and more convenient doors into the kingdom of God; yet there is but one through which one may enter and be saved: it is Jesus. But he who through him comes into the House, he also belongs there. He shall go in and go out. He is no longer under the yoke and bondage of the Law; he has freedom and filial right, and may dispose of it as of his inheritance. Consider what a blessed thing it is to be a child of God, a sheep of Jesus! To have God’s heaven as one’s house and home even while one is here below on earth and in corruption, so that whether one contemplates God’s Word or performs one’s earthly vocation, whether one prays or celebrates one’s household, whether one goes in or goes out, sleeps or wakes, lives or dies, he belongs to the Lord, has his full filial right, and finds for himself nourishment in the House. O why do so many seek for themselves other and deceptive doors of salvation, when this one stands open to them, if only they will go beneath the Cross and follow with Jesus from the Tree of the Curse to the opened grave! For Jesus is not a Door that is merely opened and shut; it also gives power to pass through it; it is a living Door, which imparts to those who seek it life from the dead, leads them through crucifixion and grave to resurrection and eternal life, not sparingly, but as grace upon grace, so that if sin has abounded, grace has abounded much more.

The Lord is therefore more than a Door; he is a Shepherd. It is not—as when one makes use of a human door—something mechanical or impersonal to enter the Father’s house through Jesus as the Door; it is, on the contrary, a living and personal relation; for he is Shepherd. He goes out into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep; and when he has found them, he lays them upon his shoulders and bears them home with joy. There is an intimate relation of the heart between Jesus and those whom he saves, as between father and son, between brother and brother. Salvation does not take place congregationally or societally; it is nothing external, such as, for example, circumcision or belonging to an orthodox church or the like, that decides one’s matter of salvation. As the prophet Ezekiel taught his countrymen that he who eats sour grapes shall himself have sore teeth, so it is also in the new covenant that only he who believes in the Son has eternal life. We must ourselves, each one of us, come together with him, the precious Savior, and wait until he calls us by name and says: “Be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven.” Then you are his own; he calls you thereafter always by the same name; you may have meeting with him when you will, more easily and more intimately than with your nearest, and he leads you out upon his beautiful pastures. Consider if a king or the President of the United States should seek you out, mention you by name, and speak familiarly and personally with you—how exalted you would feel, and how people round about would admire you and perhaps envy you! Now it is he who is King of kings, highly, highly exalted above them all, who comes to you, the most miserable and wretched of all his subjects, calls you by name, lifts you up to his throne, and says: “All this now belongs to you; you are my brother and shall inherit with me.”—It is an event which among the hosts of angels awakens admiration and song of joy, and should it have taken place without your knowing it—you, whom it most nearly concerns? O friend, we do not come sleeping into Christ’s sheepfold; he calls us by name; have you heard it? Have you answered him? Or have you despised him, crucified him anew, and trampled his holy blood beneath your feet? O no, friend, there is nothing impersonal in salvation; it concerns you—to be called by name, and to cast yourself upon the Savior’s breast as upon a good Shepherd and a dear Brother, and thereafter to follow him.

For he goes before and shows us the green pastures; as he has made himself known to us, so must we become familiar with him, know him and obey his blessed voice as the bride when she is called by her bridegroom. There is a reciprocity, an intimate relation of love and confidence between Jesus and the pardoned sinner; they do not mistake his voice; when they follow him, they do not come out of the right way, as it is written that not even the fool shall err therein; and now that we know God, yea rather are known of him, how should we again turn back to the weak and beggarly elements to be once more in bondage under them? (Gal. 4:9.)

But he is also “the Doorkeeper.” Wolves and dogs pursue the soul and would devour it; thieves and robbers seek after it; strangers and deceivers would seduce it; and where shall the poor, miserable, helpless sheep go? “Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Only come, fearful soul, and flee close up to Jesus when the enemies press upon you—hide yourself by his bosom, in his wounds, when the enemies persecute you. He stands at the Door and keeps watch, and no one can enter without his permission; once you are within his enclosure, then you are secure. In temptations, under the struggle of the flesh, under the anxiety of losing the inheritance of life, he is as a rock and a horn for Israel. For who shall separate me from the love of Christ? Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? O no, I am persuaded that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities nor powers nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Truly, he is both the Door and the Shepherd and the Doorkeeper, a strong and loving Doorkeeper who can preserve my soul until he brings it home in incorruptibility. Friend, have you gone through the Door—is Jesus your Shepherd and your Doorkeeper?
