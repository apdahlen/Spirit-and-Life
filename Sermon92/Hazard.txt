STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Hvedekornet – metaphor with Johannine and sacrificial resonance; must remain literal as “the grain of wheat.”
* Herliggjøres / Herliggjørelse – not mere honor but divine glorification through suffering and salvation history.
* Forfærdet – profound inner terror/distress, not mild anxiety.
* Hengivelse / Selvopofrelse – total self-surrender, not generic dedication.
* Gjenstridighed – active resistance of the will, not simple reluctance.
* Salighed – eschatological blessedness/salvation, not happiness.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological buildup must not be broken unnecessarily.
* Sermonic parallelisms and rhetorical questions require preservation.
* Causal chains (“derfor… saa…”) must retain logical force.

Theological Hazards:

* Atonement language (Forsoningsdøden, Synden er sonet, Vreden er stillet).
* Union with Christ imagery (indforlives i ham, levende Lem paa Kristi Legeme).
* Sanctification through death-to-self must not be moralized.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational address to the soul must remain direct and pressing.
* Do not soften warnings of perdition or calls to self-denial.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Vi ønske at se Jesus” – more than curiosity; signifies Gentile inclusion.
* “Hvedekornet falder i Jorden og dør” – John 12:24; death as condition of fruitfulness.
* “Verdens Fyrste” – Johannine title for Satan.
* “Avner… færdige til at brændes” – Matt. 3 imagery; judgment.
* “Sætte Livet ind” – idiom for risking/giving one’s whole life.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Narrative introduction (Greeks seeking Jesus).
* Christ’s declaration of the Hour.
* Paradox of glory through suffering.
* Atonement and victory over Satan.
* Direct appeal to the soul.
* Call to discipleship and self-sacrifice.
* Communal exhortation and eschatological hope.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 12:20–33 throughout.
* John 1:29 (Lamb of God).
* 2 Tim. 2:3 (good soldier of Christ).
* Rom. 12:1 (living sacrifice).
* Matt. 13 (wheat, chaff, harvest).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve direct confrontation with the reader’s conscience.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “maa,” “skal,” “kan” rendered with full necessity (“must,” “shall,” “cannot”).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

THE GRAIN OF WHEAT
Palm Sunday

John 12:20–33

Our text tells that some Greeks, who had come to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover feast, came to Jesus’ disciples and said: “We wish to see Jesus.”

When the disciples came to Jesus with this message from these foreigners, he answered them: “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.”

This Passover feast, then, is the Savior’s hour of glorification. Now that hour has come which he has awaited; that hour in which the eternal counsel for the salvation of the human race is to be fulfilled; that hour from which blessed effects shall proceed for all times and all eternities.

The Greeks’ simple words, “We wish to see Jesus,” gave occasion for the Savior to call it the hour in which he was to be glorified; for the salvation of the nations is his glorification, and this Passover feast is the hour in which our salvation is won.

But the hour of glorification is an hour of suffering. At this Passover feast the Passover lamb is to be slain, the Lamb of God who bears the sin of the world. Therefore the Savior says: “Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.”

This, then, is Jesus’ glorification: that he dies in order to become the Savior of the nations; that he gives his life over into death, so that through his resurrection he may bring life and incorruptibility to light.

Therefore the hour of glorification is a dreadful hour, of which the Savior says: “Now my soul is troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour! Yet for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name!”

It is the Son’s struggle to do the Father’s will and to reveal his counsel of love for our salvation. So great is the abyss of suffering into which the Son must descend for the sake of the fallen race that he prays for a moment to turn back—but not to withdraw himself. Overwhelmed by the dreadful guilt and offense of our sin, he nevertheless looks only to the glorification of divine love through the atoning death; and though he feels the full bitterness of death, he nevertheless prays that it may come upon him, so that the Father’s name may be glorified and the fallen race be reconciled with God.

His struggle with suffering ends in complete surrender to the Father’s will; and from heaven comes the Father’s testimony concerning the Son, that the hour of suffering, bitter though it is, is nevertheless the hour of glorification. This gives blessed assurance of victory, and the Savior testifies that the hour of his suffering and death is his hour of victory, in which power is taken from the ruler of this world; and henceforth the exalted Savior from the cross will stretch out his arms toward all people to draw them into the embrace of grace. There is no power so strong that it can keep a human being bound in the bondage of sin any longer, if that person is willing to follow the drawing of the crucified Savior. Satan is bound, death is conquered, sin is atoned for, wrath is stilled.

What do you think, O soul—shall your own resistance nevertheless become your perdition, despite the Savior’s drawing? Shall all of God’s love and all of Christ’s suffering be wasted on you, because you will not come when the Savior calls? Your own heart’s resistance is now the only obstacle to your salvation. Shall it prevail—and you lose, lose the salvation which an eternal Father-love prepared for you?

O no, do not resist him! Open to him who knocks at the door of your heart, and God’s name shall be glorified in you through your salvation. You too shall become a grain of wheat that is gathered into the granary, if you let Christ’s drawing overcome you, so that you are incorporated into him, who himself is the true grain of wheat that was laid in the ground in order to grow up from it and bear a blessed harvest.

Already we see how the wheat grows and the heavy ear is filled. Already we see God’s kingdom grow forth like a mighty tree from the little seed that was cast into the field of the world. Where are you, O soul? Are you among the noble fruit of the bloody sowing, or are you only chaff, ready to be burned? God’s kingdom can go forward without you—can you do without God’s kingdom?

O that we all might be drawn in to Christ’s cross, so that we all might become fruit of the grain of wheat and honor God’s love by being saved by his grace! But Christ’s way to glory is also the way of all his servants. As he died, so must we die, in order to live. Our entire old, sinful life, our entire corruptible and sensuous life with all its enjoyment and desire, we must give over, so that we die from sin and the world in order to live for God.

It is the hour of suffering, but it is also the hour of salvation. When a person gives up everything in order to win salvation in Christ’s death and resurrection, that person suffers the pain of crucifixion, but also gains an eternal life and an eternal glory. Let go of everything you have, and everything to which your heart clings among earthly, sensuous, and corruptible things; then you will indeed feel the agony of crucifixion, but if you then grasp Christ, dead and risen, you will also taste the blessed joy of the resurrection. Only in this way do you become a participant in the life of the grain of wheat; only in this way do you yourself become a new grain of wheat, sprung forth from the true grain of wheat, a living member of Christ’s body.

But not only that. If you wish to be Christ’s servant and go to work in his vineyard, then know that it is the same way for you as for him: the way of self-surrender and self-sacrifice. If there is to come fruit from your life, fruit for God’s kingdom, then prepare yourself to suffer hardship as a soldier of Jesus Christ. Your entire life must you stake, if there is to be any blessed fruit. From half surrender, half heart, half life, and half death there comes only imperfect fruit.

Be unsparing in your surrender in God’s work and do not spare yourself; then you too shall become like a grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies, and from which much fruit grows. Your life in God is not given to you so that you should live for yourself alone and win for yourself an eternal glory. If you are to be to the praise of God’s love, then let your life be a service of love as an offering, in which you live for God’s people and God’s kingdom, so that there may be blessing with you wherever you go, and blessed fruit from your labor.

See what fruit there is from the lives of those who truly have followed in the Savior’s footsteps and sacrificed themselves wholly for the Lord’s cause! Let us also follow in the same footsteps; and if we then become participants in suffering, it is nevertheless only incorruptible honor to suffer for him who suffered for us. And our brief hour of suffering shall become a bright day of eternal glory for us.

Awake, you soldiers of the Lord, and let there be a whole spirit of sacrifice among us, so that the cold spirit of selfishness of the world must retreat in shame before the power of Christ’s love, and the Lord’s field shall put forth a glorious harvest among us, to the praise of God’s love and to the salvation of human hearts.

Stake your life, and you shall win an eternal life; stake your life, and you shall see blessing and rich fruit from your life. Do not fear the pain: the way of glory is a way of tribulation. For God’s love is revealed in Christ’s death on the cross for the sin of the world, and only through Christ’s cross are our hearts filled with God’s love, so that we also are able to present ourselves as a living, holy, and God-pleasing sacrifice.
