STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “raabte” — not merely “said loudly,” but proclaimed with solemn urgency.
* “foragter” / “forkaste” — carries judicial and covenantal rejection, not mere disregard.
* “annammer” — archaic form meaning to receive in faith; more than passive acceptance.
* “Befaling” — command in authoritative, divine sense; not suggestion.
* “evigt Liv” — theological term denoting participation in divine life, not mere endless duration.
* “Grund,” “Grundvold,” “Klippe” — layered metaphors of foundation and rock; must remain distinct yet coherent.
* “forlader sig paa” — to rely upon existentially.
* “Fortrøstning” — confident trust rooted in faith.
* “Hjertelag” — inner disposition, essential will of God.
* “beseglet” — sealed in covenantal, sacrificial sense.
* “Mag t” (Magt) — authority, right, granted power.
* “forgjæves” — in vain, rendered empty.
* “Fortabelsen” — perdition, eternal ruin.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended sermonic periods with accumulating clauses.
* Conditional constructions with theological consequence.
* Parallelisms: “Klippen er der … Lyset er der …”
* Repetition for emphasis (e.g., “den, som …”) which must not be reduced.
* Escalating rhetorical sequences (“Lad kun Døden komme …”).

Theological Hazards:

* Unity of Son and Father in revelation.
* Christ as Light and Rock — biblical Christology.
* Word as judge on the last day.
* Salvation vs. condemnation tied to reception of the Word.
* Eternal life as present possession in the Son.

Voice Hazards:

* Direct address to the soul (“Vil du da, Sjæl …”).
* Severe warning against presumption.
* Consolation and threat held in tension.
* Solemn pastoral earnestness that must not be sentimentalized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Hjertets Klippe” — Psalm 73:26; signifies God as ultimate sustaining reality.
* “Verden forgaar med dens Lyst” — 1 John 2:17.
* “Om jeg end skulde vandre i Dødsskyggens Dal” — Psalm 23:4.
* “støder ingen ud” — John 6:37.
* “saamange som ham annammede” — John 1:12.
* “Herrens Aabenbarelsesdag” — eschatological Day of the Lord.

Literal renderings would weaken force if idiomatic resonance is ignored. Where possible, established biblical English phrasing (without archaic pronouns) should be retained.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Faith requires a firm foundation; that foundation is Jesus.
* Anthropological premise: The soul is immortal and requires eternal ground.
* Negative demonstration: The world cannot provide lasting security.
* Positive assertion: Jesus reveals the Father and is the Rock and Light.
* Call to conversion: Turn toward the Light.
* Clarification: Faith builds on Christ, not on subjective states.
* Consolation: Christ receives all who come.
* Warning: Rejection results in judgment by the Word.
* Eschatological conclusion: Stand on the Rock and remain unshaken.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 12:44–50 (primary text).
* Psalm 73:26.
* 1 John 2:17.
* Psalm 23:4.
* John 6:37.
* John 1:12.
* General Johannine themes: Light vs. darkness; Word as judge.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain warning concerning eternal fire and perdition.
* Preserve direct address and urgency.
* Avoid rhetorical softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skal” — shall / will (determinative, not tentative).
* “maa” implied necessity — must.
* Maintain inevitability of judgment and promise.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* “Tro” — faith.
* “Grund / Klippe” — foundation / Rock.
* “Frelse” — salvation.
* “Fortabelse” — perdition.
* “evigt Liv” — eternal life.
* “Ord” — Word (capitalized when doctrinally weighty in context of Christ’s utterance).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Rock, Light, darkness, blindness, foundation, seal, fire.
* Do not reduce metaphor to abstraction.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Consolation: Christ receives all.
* Severity: rejected Savior becomes judge.
* Final triumphant assurance.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long accumulative sentences.
* Maintain rhythmic exhortation.
* Retain climactic repetition.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE‑PRESERVING)

The Firm Foundation of Faith

Second Day of Pentecost

John 12:44–50. But Jesus cried out and said: He who believes in me believes not in me, but in him who sent me; and he who sees me sees him who sent me. I have come as a Light into the world, that whoever believes in me shall not remain in darkness. And if anyone hears my words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. He who rejects me and does not receive my words has that which judges him: the Word which I have spoken, that shall judge him on the last day. For I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me, he has given me commandment what I shall say and what I shall speak; and I know that his commandment is eternal life. What therefore I speak, I speak as the Father has said to me.

This Word, of which it is written that Jesus cried it out among the Jews, is of a peculiar and solemn significance. It concerns the firm foundation upon which faith builds when it builds upon Jesus. It therefore also concerns the dreadful responsibility that follows upon despising and rejecting him.

A human soul requires firm ground on which to build. It is immortal, and if it is to find a lasting foundation on which to build, then there can be no question of anything perishable. Take all the best and strongest that the world has to offer, and it shall soon show itself, under serious consideration and thorough testing, that however good it may seem, yet it is not something upon which one may rely for eternity. The world passes away with its lust; and either the world leaves us, or we leave the world, and in either case our trust is gone and our confidence in vain. Blessed therefore is he who can say with the Psalmist: Though my flesh and my heart fail, God is the Rock of my heart and my portion forever.

Thus the Rock of the heart is the Lord himself. Nothing less is required. Therefore also does Jesus so powerfully testify this, that he who believes in him does not believe in a man, but in God who sent him. Jesus is sent into the world to reveal the Father and the Father’s eternal counsel of salvation for souls. Sin had made a separation between God and men, between the Father and his children. And the eyes of sin were blinded by the false glory of the world and closed to the true and real beauty of heaven and of the Father’s home; and instead of seeking the eternal and imperishable things, the hearts of men are drawn to the sinful and the sensuous. Then God sent his Son, that he should be the Light of the world. What was hidden from men by their sin and by the threats of their evil conscience — God’s eternal love, the Father’s compassionate grace — this was to be revealed through the Son. And in the midst of the restless and deceitful, faithless and disappointing world, Jesus should be the firm Rock and the true Light.

It is God’s own eternal disposition of heart that is revealed in Jesus. Now we may look into the Father’s love, if only we turn with heart and eye toward the eternal Light. So long as we walk turned away from God, with our back toward the Light, we remain in darkness; and without peace and without faith we walk uncertain and insecure forward toward a dark and hopeless night of eternity. The Rock is there, but we do not know it. The Light is there, but we do not see it. But the day we turn, and the Light from Jesus’ loving eye falls into our heart, and we come to see that the Father loves us, then it becomes otherwise for us, and it becomes otherwise with us.

For Jesus has not come that we should remain in sin and in darkness, but that we should be saved from them. If he is the Rock, then it concerns us to build upon him; if he is the Light, then it concerns us to walk in its brightness. It avails you nothing that you know that the Rock of salvation is there quite near you, so long as you do not gain a foothold upon it. It avails you nothing that the Light shines around you, if you close your eye and deliberately walk in blindness.

If the eternal Rock is here in Jesus and in his eternal Word — the Word of God’s love sealed with Jesus’ own blood and death and resurrection from the dead — then this is what matters for us: that we build upon this foundation and lay hold of this salvation. The firm foundation of faith is neither our feelings nor our understanding nor our conversion nor our prayer; the firm foundation of faith is Jesus himself; for he who believes in him believes in God who sent him. Can there be anything firmer or more reliable? Impossible; he who has the Son has also the Father; and he who has the Son has eternal life in him.

With anything less the soul cannot be satisfied. For when the form of this world passes away, and when all that is visible and sensuous disappears for us in death, then this alone is our consolation: Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

Will you then, O soul, have firm ground for your faith, then give yourself wholly over to Jesus. He has come to save the world; he has come to save you. You are welcome when you come, and however you may appear when you come. Jesus will save you; that is his unchangeable promise, and upon that you may come in full assurance. All who have ever come to him have experienced this, that he casts none out.

But do not soothe yourself with this, that Jesus has come to save the world, and therefore there is no danger. If you despise his Word, which came to save you and which loves you with eternal love, then be certain that you have that which judges you. The rejected Savior and the rejected Love shall become your judgment and an eternally burning fire for your poor, lost soul. God willed to save you, and you would not be saved — who then shall be able to rescue you from perdition? Can your sin and the pride of your heart, or the devil, save you? On the day of the Lord’s revelation you shall experience that the Word which he has spoken, and which you have despised, that shall judge you, and none shall save you from its judgment.

For Jesus’ Word is not from himself, but from the Father. Therefore the Word is also eternal life. Jesus is both the Light that shines in the darkness and the Life that overcomes death. Have you room for him in your heart; have you faith in him in your soul? This is what it concerns; for as many as received him, to them he gave authority to become children of God and to have eternal life.

Build therefore upon the Rock and believe unshakably in Jesus. Do not be satisfied that you have heard about the Rock, but set your foot upon it without fear, and you shall stand firm when all falls. Let death come, let the heart break, let hell threaten, let the world perish — if you stand upon the Rock, then know that you are secure and shall not be shaken; for the Rock of the heart is the Lord himself. Amen.
